Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. This is a semi-circular shaped wall aimed to slow down enemy forces attacking Golconda fort. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Balahissar Darwaza using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered infront of Balahissar gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. For enemies using elephants to batter the gate, Balahissar Darwaza has it's own surprises!This is the main entrance to the inner fort of Golconda encounterd while entering the fort after curtain wall and leads the way to Clapping Portico. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels provide decoration on this defence portal. Apart from the visual attraction, Balahissar Darwaza also acted as a vital defence structure to the fort. Several spike like structures can be seen on Balahissar Darwaza which were placed to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza.
