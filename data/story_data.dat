Curtain Wall
Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. This is a semi-circular shaped wall aimed to slow down enemy forces attacking Golconda fort. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Balahissar Darwaza using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered infront of Balahissar gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. For enemies using elephants to batter the gate, Balahissar Darwaza has it's own surprises!
Balahissar Darwaza
This is the main entrance to the inner fort of Golconda encounterd while entering the fort after curtain wall and leads the way to Clapping Portico. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels provide decoration on this defence portal. Apart from the visual attraction, Balahissar Darwaza also acted as a vital defence structure to the fort. Several spike like structures can be seen on Balahissar Darwaza which were placed to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza.
Clapping Portico
Upon entering the fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico. From here the path gets divided into two parts, left one leading to Aslah Khana and straight one to the Guest rooms. This portico helps in witnessing the sophisticated and wonderful accoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from Durbar hall located a few hundred meters away at the top of the hill.
Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill—by clapping. Codes were used: one clap for a friend, two for a foe (in which case, the gates along theouter walls would be shut at once, three for an honoured guest, and so on.
Mortuary Bath
The Mortuary Baths lie to the right side of the Clapping Portico. The baths were meant for the deceased royalty and harem ladies(wives and concubines) who were given the ritualistic bath before burial outside the Banjara Gate.
Victoria Cannon
Apart from the Clapping Portico, this cannon also greets anyone visiting the fort. This cannon was presented by the Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the right side of the cannon. Following the orders of Nizam this cannon was placed at Golconda Fort. Climbing the steps to the cannon, one can notice that the path from here is divided into two parts, straight one leading to the Guest rooms and the right one leading to the Nagina Bagh.
Guest Room
Taking the path straight to Clapping Portico and passing by Victoria Cannon, one can reach the pathway with Guest Rooms on the left side which are built below the ground level. This is where the royal guests used to stay. Further down this path are Akkana-Madanna Office quarters.
Akkanna Madanna Office
Following the Guest Rooms lays the office of famous Akkanna and Madanna brothers. This place was used by many clerks and lower officials serving the fort as their offices to maintain fort records. Further down this path, Nagina Bagh can be seen on the right side.
Nagina Bagh
Taking the path to the right side of the Victoria Cannon, one can reach Nagina Bagh. Nagina Bagh which means “Jewel among the Gardens” has a square layout divided into quadrants by paved pathways converging into a fountain located at the centre of the gardens. Nagina Bagh was the place where the famous Diamond trade used to take place. Merchants from different countries used to come here to buy the diamonds and other valuable stones. When entering the Nagina Bagh following the Victoria Cannon, at the foot of the tree, there is a block of iron weighing more that 200kgs. During Qutb Shahi Period, citizens who lifted this weight using a single hand were eligible for entry in the Sultan's army.
Nagina Mosque
Located at one of the corners of the Nagina Bagh is a small mosque. This mosque was constructed by one of the Sultan's of Golconda for the merchants who used to visit the fort for their trade.
Lower Tank
Following the path from the Nagina Bagh to the Commoner stairs, one can see the Lower tank on the right side. After the wonderful acoustic system, the clever water supply system of the Qutb Shahis stands out. This ingenuous water supply system ensured that tanks in the palace had continuous supply. Water from a lake named Durgam cheruvu, situated some 5 kilometers away, was transmitted through an open channel using earthen pipes which passed through the Qutb Shahi tombs to the Golconda Fort. Water received from the lake was stored in Golconda using a structure of three tanks. This is the first and lower tank which used to collect water from the lake directly. From here, water used to be sent to other tanks using earthen pipes.
Commoner Stairs
After passing by Nagina Bagh, following the path, one will reach the foot of a long staircase which will lead the way to the Durbar hall. There are three stair cases to reach the top of Golconda Fort meant for the usage of people based on their social status. This is the staircase which was used by the commoners to reach the Durbar hall to meet the Sultan. This is the longest staircase out of all the staircases. Other monuments like Ramdas Jail, Ambar Khana, Ibrahim Mosque, and MahaKali Temple can be seen while walking down this path before reaching the final destination of Durbar hall.
Middle Tank
This is the second tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the first tank and can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas jail. These tanks have pipes at their bottom and top. Water is filled in these tanks from the pipes situated at the top of these tanks. When the pressure is increased at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of water, pipes at bottom of the tank pump water to the next tank.
Upper Tank
This is the third and last tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the second tank and can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas Jail. It is located at a highr altitude relative to all the other tanks in Golconda fort. This tank receives water from the second tank and distributes it to the entire fort. Since, this tank is located at a higher altitute, gravity does all the work in distributing water to all other places in the fort.
Ramdas Jail
Walking down the Commoner stairs and after passing by the Upper Tank, a small door can be seen on a rocky structure on the left side of the stairs. This is where Kancherla Goppana also known as Ramdas was imprisoned by the Sultan for embezzling Royal funds to build a temple for a Hindhu God Ram at Bhadrachalam. Food was provided to him from the entries in the ceiling. During his imprisonment Ramdas painted the Hindhu Gods Ram along with others on the walls of the prison. This structure was believed to be used as part of granary before imprisioning Ramdas. The main granary Ambar Khana is right above this structure.
Ambar Khana
Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana has a Persian inscription on black basalt stating that it was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary storage for the fort.
Ibrahim Mosque
Right above the Ambar Khana to the left side of Commoner Stairs lies Ibrahim Mosque. This mosque was built by the fourth king Ibrahim Qutub Shah. This mosque was built on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets. The courtyard of the mosque extends up to the ramparts providing magnificent views of the landscape below. Ibrahim Mosque is a good example of Qutb Shahi architecture. This simple yet beautiful mosque is marked by three arches with the central being larger than the flanking smaller arches on it’s either sides. At the base it has nine small arches. The external stucco decorations represent typical Qutb Shahi art style.
Sri Jagadamba Mahakali Temple
This is the last structure to be encountered before Durbar Hall while walking by the Commoner Stairs. This is a Hindu temple which belongs to the Kakatiya period. It is carved out of a huge boulder and has colorful frescos of the Goddess Kali on the white-painted facade.
Durbar Hall
At the summit of the hill is the three-storeyed breezy Durbar Hall(“Throne Room”), with a rooftop pavilion. Also known as Baradari, this is the highest point in the fort. This is the final destination of both Commoner Stairs and Royal Stairs. This is a double-storeyed structure, the lower storey functioning as the Diwan-e-Aam(the Hall of Public Audience), the upper as the Diwan-e-Khaas(the Hall of Private Audience). From here, the Sultan used catch a view of entire city of Hyderabad. At a particular location in this Durbar Hall, one can hear the clapping sound produced at Balahissar Darwaza. The ventilation system of the Durbar Hall is absolutely fabulous having exotic designs. They were so intricately designed that cool breeze could reach the interiors of the fort, providing a respite from the heat of summer. The rumoured secret tunnel from Golconda to Charminar and Gosha Mahal which was said to be designed for the escape of royal family is said to be in Durbar hall.
Royal Stairs
These are the stairs used by the Royal family to travel from Durbar hall to their palaces. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter compared to the other ones. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals. To keep the palanquins stable horizontally, two people carrying used to be tall and the other two were short.
Zenana Bodyguards
Coming down the Royal Stairs, the Sultan's palanquin had to pass by this place to reach other structures like Kilwat, Rani Mahil, and Dad Mahal. This is where the women bodyguards of the Zenana used to have quarters.
Zenana Mosque
Secluded from other locations and surrounded by walls lies a small mosque near Zenana Bodyguards. This is a prayer place for the Royal women and other women staying in women's area, the Zenana.
Zenana Dressing Room
Just next to Kilwat, on the right side of it's wall is a Dressing room. This dressing room used by the women in Zenana used to be filled with mirrors, prefumes and other extravagant makeup materials known at that time. There is also a small bathtub present at the middle of the dressing room. This was the same dressing room used by famous dancers Taramati and Premamati who were married to Sultan.
Kilwat
Standing infront of the Rani Mahal and to the side of Zenana Dressing room lies Kilwat. This is a small two storied chamber specially designed to be the Royal private quarters.
Hall of Whispers
Situated at the ground floor of Rani mahal, this room was used by the women of the palace to entertain guests. The Sultan sitting in the first floor, to keep tabs on what was discussed, could even listen in on private conversations because the walls were designed to amplify sound.
Rani Mahal
Standing between Kilwat and Taramati mosque is Rani Mahal holding precious memories of all the Begums that stayed here. The queen of Sultan and other Royal ladies used to stay in these two storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is Shahi Hammam which used to serve as Royal Bath tub. This first floor also has a small room from where Sultan and his Begum used to watch proceedings of Dad Mahal.
Dad Mahal
Another live example of wonderful accoustic system employed at Golconda, Dad Mahal lies in between Taramati Mosque and Kilwat. This hall is also known as Hall of Justice. Sultan used to hear grievances of the people and pass judgements on criminals at this place. This hall is filled with porticos. They have been designed in such a way that even a whisper at one end of a portico can be heard from the other end of it. Sultan used to sit on the balcony overseeing the proceedings. This arrangement doesn't allow any commoners to see the Sultan and helped in avoiding assassination atempts in court. Soldiers would collect any document that the people would want to submit to Sultan and drop it in a canister which used to hung from the first floor by one of the Sultan's servants. These servants used to collect the documents from the canister after pulling it up and read the contents to the Sultan. The person presenting his case had to stand below the portico and speak out his grievance. Standing below the portico and speaking or making a sound, one can hear it getting amplified. This eliminated the threat from any concealed weapons which would get their sound amplified while trying to be drawn.
Shahi Hammam
Situated at the first floor of Rani Mahal, this place was a bathtub for Kings and Queens. A portion of water from the tanks is heated up and was routed to the Shahi Hammam. There were different earthen pipes for hot and cold water. Another set of earthen pipes were used to dispose the water from the bath.
Bhagmathi Palace
Standing to the left side of Dad Mahal and right side of Stable, lie Bhagmathi Palace. This palace was said to be built by Sultan Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah for his lover Bhagmathi. Sultan also built a city and named after her as Bhagyanagar which later changed to Hyderabad.
Stable
This place lie next to the inner Fort wall right next to the left side of Bhagmati Palace. This Stable was used to keep Camels and Elephants.
Taramathi Mosque
Situated right next to Nakkar Khana is a mosque. This mosque is said to be dedicated for the dancer and queen Taramati.
Nakkar Khana
While walking by Aslah Khana, an open space can be seen on it's right side. This is where the Drum bearers used to perform during festivals and cermonies.
Aslah Khana
Also called as Silah Khana, This place is used as armoury during Qutub Shahi times. It is said to have around 150 rooms. Some of the long cannons with few cannon balls are displayed in one of the large arched windows here. Since Silah Khana is essential to fort defences, it is situated close to Balahissar gate.
Dhobhi Ghat
Dhobhi Ghat is located in the farthest corner of the inner fort which is curently inaccessible. All the clothes of the royal family used to be washed here.

Akkana and Maddana were the Hindu ministers during the rule of Abul Hasan Tana Shah, the last Qutub Shahi ruler. They were known for their administrative skill and business acumen. There were no computers at that time, so filing the information of such a vast kingdom and informing the Sultan had to be very official. Check the holes in the walls, where curtains were used as room separators and shelves for storing the records. Follow the directions to reach the top of this office. A short climb up the stairs will take you there. The view from the top of the administrative office is good to take a picture. The good view helps you notice that the whole fort is built on natural rocks.

Sultan Quli was the first ruler to rule over this place. He fortified the inner structure of the mud fort which stood here. His son, Ibhrahim Quli, further strengthened it and constructed the inner places, moques and other buldings. You can still see the splendour that was here. The strong shia following and lineage with Persia encouraged the constant influx of Persians who made a strong impact on all walks of life and culture. During the Qutub Shahi rule of 175 lunar years, Golconda and Hyderabad blossomed with activities of trade and culture. Very soon, Golconda became a hub of composite culture with unique architecture and monuments of a distinct Qutub Shahi style, a fusuion of Indian and Persian styles. This indo-persian fusion extended beyond architecture and influenced people's lives in every sphere. This unique culture which evolved was known as Deccani which is popular now as Hyderabadi culture.

What you are seeing is the Musa Baoli. Baoli means the well, Water was supplied to the reservoir through underground pipes from a secret lake, Durgan Chiru. The source of the water was kept secret to prevent any poisoning of it. The step well used to be a work of art, with carvings and mound in and around. See if you can find anything now. The water was raised by the persian wheel was stored in overhead tanks at diffferent levels, which you will notice as you climb up. This collected water was distributed to various palaces, apartments, roof gardens, fountains and the citadel of the entire fort. All this was done through stone aquaducts and a network of earthen pipes through gravity. So advanced was the engineering poweress, technological capability and the mastery over design and function.

Golconda is built on a 400 foothill. It had 3 lines of massive fortification walls, one within the other, rising above 12 metres in height. A deep moat with a circumference of 7km sourrounded the fort and the town. There were 8 imposing gateways, 84 bastions rising upto 18 metres in height mounted with cannons of varying caliber. This fort was impregnable in the medieval deccan. The defeat of the kakitiyas by the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century saw the saw the appointment of governers to rule these areas. One of the governers, Bahaman Shah revolted against the sultanate and formed the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Sultanate.

Imagine yourself to be a prospective soldier, do you see iron weight with a ring? Usually there are people there trying to lift it. If you can lift it, you are qualified to be recruited into the army. One has to prove his strength to join the army. Now, I would suggest you to avoid trying to lift the 225kg iron rock. The Qutub Shahi recruited soldiers from far away places like Arabia, Turkey, Arabia and Central Asia. They had a standing international army of 60,000 soldiers. The portuguese regularly supplied arms, in addition to the locally manufactured arms at Nizamabad, gunpowder and cartiridges at Machlipatinam.
