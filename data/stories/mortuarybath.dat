Lying to the right side of Clapping Portico are Mortuary Baths which served as a final stopping point for the deceased royalty before proceeding further to their final resting place, the Qutb Shahi tombs. Built in the style of Turkish and Persian baths, this structure was meant for the ceremonial bathing of deceased royalty and women belonging to Royal Harem before further ceremonies. It has separate cisterns for hot and cold water with arrangement of concealed terracotta conduits plaster with lime mortar for ensuring regular water supply. After the bodies of the deceased have been washed, they were dressed according to the custom and were taken for burial through the Murda gate located at the side of the fort.
