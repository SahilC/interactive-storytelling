Just after the Guest Rooms lies the secretariat of the Qutb Shahi’s, bearing many rooms. This place was used by many clerks and lower officials serving the fort as their offices to maintain fort records. If carefully observed, the inside of the complex is built in such a way to let enough sunlight for the functioning of the secretariat and there are holes drilled in the walls for curtains to be tied to separate each room. These were the same offices occupied by the famous Akkanna and Madanna brothers during their tenure as ministers for Abul Hasan, the Eighth and last King of Golconda. As the last king of Golconda was being so refined in his pleasures, the kingdom was ably managed by Madanna so much that his power was felt beyond Golconda. When the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb attacked and won against Golconda for the first time in 1685, one of the terms imposed on Golconda was the dismissal of Akkanna-Madanna duo. Even facing the impending doom, the king of Golconda couldn’t dismiss the brother duo of which he knew their value in warring times, telling us much about the role they played in Golconda’s survival. But, other members of the royal family failing to understand the intellectual importance of these ministers got them murdered on their way to home during a night. They were able to kill the persons, but the Akkanna-Madanna duo still live on in the memories of local people as heroes who were loyal to their kingdom till their last breath, giving their all to their mother-land. Proceeding further down this path, Nagina Bagh can be seen on the right side.
