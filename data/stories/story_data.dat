Curtain Wall
Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. This is a semi-circular shaped wall aimed to slow down enemy forces attacking Golconda fort. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Balahissar Darwaza using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered infront of Balahissar gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. For enemies using elephants to batter the gate, Balahissar Darwaza has it's own surprises!
Balahissar Darwaza
This is the main entrance to the inner fort of Golconda encounterd while entering the fort after curtain wall and leads the way to Clapping Portico. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels provide decoration on this defence portal. Apart from the visual attraction, Balahissar Darwaza also acted as a vital defence structure to the fort. Several spike like structures can be seen on Balahissar Darwaza which were placed to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza.
Clapping Portico
Upon entering the fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico. From here the path gets divided into two parts, left one leading to Aslah Khana and straight one to the Guest rooms. This portico helps in witnessing the sophisticated and wonderful accoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from Durbar hall located a few hundred meters away at the top of the hill.
Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill—by clapping. Codes were used: one clap for a friend, two for a foe (in which case, the gates along theouter walls would be shut at once, three for an honoured guest, and so on.
Mortuary Bath
The Mortuary Baths lie to the right side of the Clapping Portico. The baths were meant for the deceased royalty and harem ladies(wives and concubines) who were given the ritualistic bath before burial outside the Banjara Gate.
Victoria Cannon
Apart from the Clapping Portico, this cannon also greets anyone visiting the fort. This cannon was presented by the Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the right side of the cannon. Following the orders of Nizam this cannon was placed at Golconda Fort. Climbing the steps to the cannon, one can notice that the path from here is divided into two parts, straight one leading to the Guest rooms and the right one leading to the Nagina Bagh.
Guest Room
Taking the path straight to Clapping Portico and passing by Victoria Cannon, one can reach the pathway with Guest Rooms on the left side which are built below the ground level. This is where the royal guests used to stay. Further down this path are Akkana-Madanna Office quarters.
Akkanna Madanna Office
Following the Guest Rooms lays the office of famous Akkanna and Madanna brothers. This place was used by many clerks and lower officials serving the fort as their offices to maintain fort records. Further down this path, Nagina Bagh can be seen on the right side.
Nagina Bagh
Taking the path to the right side of the Victoria Cannon, one can reach Nagina Bagh. Nagina Bagh which means “Jewel among the Gardens” has a square layout divided into quadrants by paved pathways converging into a fountain located at the centre of the gardens. Nagina Bagh was the place where the famous Diamond trade used to take place. Merchants from different countries used to come here to buy the diamonds and other valuable stones. When entering the Nagina Bagh following the Victoria Cannon, at the foot of the tree, there is a block of iron weighing more that 200kgs. During Qutb Shahi Period, citizens who lifted this weight using a single hand were eligible for entry in the Sultan's army.
Nagina Mosque
Located at one of the corners of the Nagina Bagh is a small mosque. This mosque was constructed by one of the Sultan's of Golconda for the merchants who used to visit the fort for their trade.
Lower Tank
Following the path from the Nagina Bagh to the Commoner stairs, one can see the Lower tank on the right side. After the wonderful acoustic system, the clever water supply system of the Qutb Shahis stands out. This ingenuous water supply system ensured that tanks in the palace had continuous supply. Water from a lake named Durgam cheruvu, situated some 5 kilometers away, was transmitted through an open channel using earthen pipes which passed through the Qutb Shahi tombs to the Golconda Fort. Water received from the lake was stored in Golconda using a structure of three tanks. This is the first and lower tank which used to collect water from the lake directly. From here, water used to be sent to other tanks using earthen pipes.
Commoner Stairs
After passing by Nagina Bagh, following the path, one will reach the foot of a long staircase which will lead the way to the Durbar hall. There are three stair cases to reach the top of Golconda Fort meant for the usage of people based on their social status. This is the staircase which was used by the commoners to reach the Durbar hall to meet the Sultan. This is the longest staircase out of all the staircases. Other monuments like Ramdas Jail, Ambar Khana, Ibrahim Mosque, and MahaKali Temple can be seen while walking down this path before reaching the final destination of Durbar hall.
Middle Tank
This is the second tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the first tank and can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas jail. These tanks have pipes at their bottom and top. Water is filled in these tanks from the pipes situated at the top of these tanks. When the pressure is increased at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of water, pipes at bottom of the tank pump water to the next tank.
Upper Tank
This is the third and last tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the second tank and can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas Jail. It is located at a highr altitude relative to all the other tanks in Golconda fort. This tank receives water from the second tank and distributes it to the entire fort. Since, this tank is located at a higher altitute, gravity does all the work in distributing water to all other places in the fort.
Ramdas Jail
Walking down the Commoner stairs and after passing by the Upper Tank, a small door can be seen on a rocky structure on the left side of the stairs. This is where Kancherla Goppana also known as Ramdas was imprisoned by the Sultan for embezzling Royal funds to build a temple for a Hindhu God Ram at Bhadrachalam. Food was provided to him from the entries in the ceiling. During his imprisonment Ramdas painted the Hindhu Gods Ram along with others on the walls of the prison. This structure was believed to be used as part of granary before imprisioning Ramdas. The main granary Ambar Khana is right above this structure.
Ambar Khana
Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana has a Persian inscription on black basalt stating that it was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary storage for the fort.
Ibrahim Mosque
Right above the Ambar Khana to the left side of Commoner Stairs lies Ibrahim Mosque. This mosque was built by the fourth king Ibrahim Qutub Shah. This mosque was built on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets. The courtyard of the mosque extends up to the ramparts providing magnificent views of the landscape below. Ibrahim Mosque is a good example of Qutb Shahi architecture. This simple yet beautiful mosque is marked by three arches with the central being larger than the flanking smaller arches on it’s either sides. At the base it has nine small arches. The external stucco decorations represent typical Qutb Shahi art style.
Sri Jagadamba Mahakali Temple
This is the last structure to be encountered before Durbar Hall while walking by the Commoner Stairs. This is a Hindu temple which belongs to the Kakatiya period. It is carved out of a huge boulder and has colorful frescos of the Goddess Kali on the white-painted facade.
Durbar Hall
At the summit of the hill is the three-storeyed breezy Durbar Hall(“Throne Room”), with a rooftop pavilion. Also known as Baradari, this is the highest point in the fort. This is the final destination of both Commoner Stairs and Royal Stairs. This is a double-storeyed structure, the lower storey functioning as the Diwan-e-Aam(the Hall of Public Audience), the upper as the Diwan-e-Khaas(the Hall of Private Audience). From here, the Sultan used catch a view of entire city of Hyderabad. At a particular location in this Durbar Hall, one can hear the clapping sound produced at Balahissar Darwaza. The ventilation system of the Durbar Hall is absolutely fabulous having exotic designs. They were so intricately designed that cool breeze could reach the interiors of the fort, providing a respite from the heat of summer. The rumoured secret tunnel from Golconda to Charminar and Gosha Mahal which was said to be designed for the escape of royal family is said to be in Durbar hall.
Royal Stairs
These are the stairs used by the Royal family to travel from Durbar hall to their palaces. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter compared to the other ones. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals. To keep the palanquins stable horizontally, two people carrying used to be tall and the other two were short.
Zenana Bodyguards
Coming down the Royal Stairs, the Sultan's palanquin had to pass by this place to reach other structures like Kilwat, Rani Mahil, and Dad Mahal. This is where the women bodyguards of the Zenana used to have quarters.
Zenana Mosque
Secluded from other locations and surrounded by walls lies a small mosque near Zenana Bodyguards. This is a prayer place for the Royal women and other women staying in women's area, the Zenana.
Zenana Dressing Room
Just next to Kilwat, on the right side of it's wall is a Dressing room. This dressing room used by the women in Zenana used to be filled with mirrors, prefumes and other extravagant makeup materials known at that time. There is also a small bathtub present at the middle of the dressing room. This was the same dressing room used by famous dancers Taramati and Premamati who were married to Sultan.
Kilwat
Standing infront of the Rani Mahal and to the side of Zenana Dressing room lies Kilwat. This is a small two storied chamber specially designed to be the Royal private quarters.
Hall of Whispers
Situated at the ground floor of Rani mahal, this room was used by the women of the palace to entertain guests. The Sultan sitting in the first floor, to keep tabs on what was discussed, could even listen in on private conversations because the walls were designed to amplify sound.
Rani Mahal
Standing between Kilwat and Taramati mosque is Rani Mahal holding precious memories of all the Begums that stayed here. The queen of Sultan and other Royal ladies used to stay in these two storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is Shahi Hammam which used to serve as Royal Bath tub. This first floor also has a small room from where Sultan and his Begum used to watch proceedings of Dad Mahal.
Dad Mahal
Another live example of wonderful accoustic system employed at Golconda, Dad Mahal lies in between Taramati Mosque and Kilwat. This hall is also known as Hall of Justice. Sultan used to hear grievances of the people and pass judgements on criminals at this place. This hall is filled with porticos. They have been designed in such a way that even a whisper at one end of a portico can be heard from the other end of it. Sultan used to sit on the balcony overseeing the proceedings. This arrangement doesn't allow any commoners to see the Sultan and helped in avoiding assassination atempts in court. Soldiers would collect any document that the people would want to submit to Sultan and drop it in a canister which used to hung from the first floor by one of the Sultan's servants. These servants used to collect the documents from the canister after pulling it up and read the contents to the Sultan. The person presenting his case had to stand below the portico and speak out his grievance. Standing below the portico and speaking or making a sound, one can hear it getting amplified. This eliminated the threat from any concealed weapons which would get their sound amplified while trying to be drawn.
Shahi Hammam
Situated at the first floor of Rani Mahal, this place was a bathtub for Kings and Queens. A portion of water from the tanks is heated up and was routed to the Shahi Hammam. There were different earthen pipes for hot and cold water. Another set of earthen pipes were used to dispose the water from the bath.
Bhagmathi Palace
Standing to the left side of Dad Mahal and right side of Stable, lie Bhagmathi Palace. This palace was said to be built by Sultan Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah for his lover Bhagmathi. Sultan also built a city and named after her as Bhagyanagar which later changed to Hyderabad.
Stable
This place lie next to the inner Fort wall right next to the left side of Bhagmati Palace. This Stable was used to keep Camels and Elephants.
Taramathi Mosque
Situated right next to Nakkar Khana is a mosque. This mosque is said to be dedicated for the dancer and queen Taramati.
Nakkar Khana
While walking by Aslah Khana, an open space can be seen on it's right side. This is where the Drum bearers used to perform during festivals and cermonies.
Aslah Khana
Also called as Silah Khana, This place is used as armoury during Qutub Shahi times. It is said to have around 150 rooms. Some of the long cannons with few cannon balls are displayed in one of the large arched windows here. Since Silah Khana is essential to fort defences, it is situated close to Balahissar gate.
Dhobhi Ghat
Dhobhi Ghat is located in the farthest corner of the inner fort which is curently inaccessible. All the clothes of the royal family used to be washed here.

Akkana and Maddana were the Hindu ministers during the rule of Abul Hasan Tana Shah, the last Qutub Shahi ruler. They were known for their administrative skill and business acumen. There were no computers at that time, so filing the information of such a vast kingdom and informing the Sultan had to be very official. Check the holes in the walls, where curtains were used as room separators and shelves for storing the records. Follow the directions to reach the top of this office. A short climb up the stairs will take you there. The view from the top of the administrative office is good to take a picture. The good view helps you notice that the whole fort is built on natural rocks.

Sultan Quli was the first ruler to rule over this place. He fortified the inner structure of the mud fort which stood here. His son, Ibhrahim Quli, further strengthened it and constructed the inner places, moques and other buldings. You can still see the splendour that was here. The strong shia following and lineage with Persia encouraged the constant influx of Persians who made a strong impact on all walks of life and culture. During the Qutub Shahi rule of 175 lunar years, Golconda and Hyderabad blossomed with activities of trade and culture. Very soon, Golconda became a hub of composite culture with unique architecture and monuments of a distinct Qutub Shahi style, a fusuion of Indian and Persian styles. This indo-persian fusion extended beyond architecture and influenced people's lives in every sphere. This unique culture which evolved was known as Deccani which is popular now as Hyderabadi culture.

What you are seeing is the Musa Baoli. Baoli means the well, Water was supplied to the reservoir through underground pipes from a secret lake, Durgan Chiru. The source of the water was kept secret to prevent any poisoning of it. The step well used to be a work of art, with carvings and mound in and around. See if you can find anything now. The water was raised by the persian wheel was stored in overhead tanks at diffferent levels, which you will notice as you climb up. This collected water was distributed to various palaces, apartments, roof gardens, fountains and the citadel of the entire fort. All this was done through stone aquaducts and a network of earthen pipes through gravity. So advanced was the engineering poweress, technological capability and the mastery over design and function.

Golconda is built on a 400 foothill. It had 3 lines of massive fortification walls, one within the other, rising above 12 metres in height. A deep moat with a circumference of 7km sourrounded the fort and the town. There were 8 imposing gateways, 84 bastions rising upto 18 metres in height mounted with cannons of varying caliber. This fort was impregnable in the medieval deccan. The defeat of the kakitiyas by the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century saw the saw the appointment of governers to rule these areas. One of the governers, Bahaman Shah revolted against the sultanate and formed the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Sultanate. After the death of Mohammed Shah Bahaman, the deccan sultanate broke up into five principalities, Ahmednagar, Berar, Bijapur, Bidar and Golconda. Sultan Quli, the subedar and governor of Golconda declared himself independent and laid the foundation of a new dyansty, Qutub Shahi dynasty in 1550AD.

All of diamond trade was done here on the open Nagina Bagh. The trade flourished under Qutub Shahi rule. This was the only place in the world where diamonds were available and traded in the world in the sixteenth century. Traders from all over the world thronged to Nagina Bagh to procure the gems and diamonds. The world famous diamonds, Kohinoor, The Hope and The Jacob were first traded at this very place. The kohinoor is believed to be found in the eleventh century. changed several hands and adorns the Queen of England's crown today.

Imagine yourself to be a prospective soldier, do you see iron weight with a ring? Usually there are people there trying to lift it. If you can lift it, you are qualified to be recruited into the army. One has to prove his strength to join the army. Now, I would suggest you to avoid trying to lift the 225kg iron rock. The Qutub Shahi recruited soldiers from far away places like Arabia, Turkey, Arabia and Central Asia. They had a standing international army of 60,000 soldiers. The portuguese regularly supplied arms, in addition to the locally manufactured arms at Nizamabad, gunpowder and cartiridges at Machlipatinam.

Curtain Wall
Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. The original Curtain Wall was much bigger and was destroyed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb during the final war between Mighty Mughal Empire and Golconda Sultanate, the last standing Deccan Sultanate.Although, current wall is a replica of the original wall built in Twentieth Century it provides enough insight to people in understanding the functioning of Golconda fort’s mighty defences.This structure is a semi-circular shaped wall aimed to slow down enemy forces attacking Golconda fort. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Balahissar Darwaza using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered in front of Balahissar gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. Due to it’s shorter distance from the Balahissar Darwaza, even Battering Elephants couldn’t build up enough charge to break the Fort’s entrance gate. For enemies still wishing to try their luck with using Battering Elephants to batter the gate, Balahissar Darwaza has it's own surprises waiting for them!
Balahissar Darwaza
Standing between the enemy forces and the king of Golconda is Balahissar Darwaza, the final defence structure of the fort. This entrance stands right next to curtain wall and leads the way to the inside of the fort through Clapping Portico,  which played an important role in fort’s communication networks. Being the main entrance to the fort, Balahissar Darwaza welcomes guests with it’s pleasant decorations. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels used as the part of decoration to the entrance, serve as the proof to the acknowledgement and harmonious nature of the Qutb Shahi’s to the multi-cultural society. Apart from the visual attraction, Balahissar Darwaza, working along side with Curtain Wall also acted as a vital defence structure to the fort. Like every other gate, Balahissar Darwaza’s main function is to keep the unwanted out and for this purpose, the designers of the gate employed quite a few tactics. Several spike like structures can be seen on Balahissar Darwaza which were placed tactically on it to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza. This well thought out piece of design tells us much about the defence tactics employed by the forts of this type.
Clapping Portico
Upon entering the inner fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico which was a vital structure in Fort’s communication network. From here, the path gets divided into two parts, left one leading by the Aslah Khana and straight one by the Akkanna Madanna Offices. This portico stands as a proof to sophisticated and wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from Durbar hall located a few hundred meters away at the top of the hill. This communication system was used to relay important and urgent messages from here to the Durbar Hall. Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill, using different codes by clapping. One clap for a friend, two for a foe, three for an honoured guest, and so on. Incase of a foe, the outer walls were shut at once.
Mortuary Bath
Lying to the right side of Clapping Portico are Mortuary Baths which served as a final stopping point for the deceased royalty before proceeding further to their final resting place, the Qutb Shahi tombs. Built in the style of Turkish and Persian baths, this structure was meant for the ceremonial bathing of deceased royalty and women belonging to Royal Harem before further ceremonies. It has separate cisterns for hot and cold water with arrangement of concealed terracotta conduits plaster with lime mortar for ensuring regular water supply. After the bodies of the deceased have been washed, they were dressed according to the custom and were taken for burial through the Murda gate located at the side of the fort. 
Victoria Cannon 
This is a Cannon placed under clapping portico, which acts as a great tourist attraction. This cannon was presented by Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the left side of the cannon. This cannon was placed at Golconda Fort following the orders of Nizam. Climbing the steps to the cannon, one can notice that the path from here is divided into two parts, straight one leading to the Akkanna Madanna offices and the right one leading to the Nagina Bagh.
Guest Room
Taking the path straight from Clapping Portico and passing by Victoria Cannon, one can reach the pathway with Guest Rooms on the left side which are built below the ground level. This is where the royal guests used to stay. A mosque was built for the guests to offer their prayers. Further down this path are Akkana-Madanna Office quarters.
Akkanna Madanna Office
Just after the Guest Rooms lies the secretariat of the Qutb Shahi’s, bearing many rooms. This place was used by many clerks and lower officials serving the fort as their offices to maintain fort records. If carefully observed, the inside of the complex is built in such a way to let enough sunlight for the functioning of the secretariat and there are holes drilled in the walls for curtains to be tied to separate each room. These were the same offices occupied by the famous Akkanna and Madanna brothers during their tenure as ministers for Abul Hasan, the Eighth and last King of Golconda. As the last king of Golconda was being so refined in his pleasures, the kingdom was ably managed by Madanna so much that his power was felt beyond Golconda. When the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb attacked and won against Golconda for the first time in 1685, one of the terms imposed on Golconda was the dismissal of Akkanna-Madanna duo. Even facing the impending doom, the king of Golconda couldn’t dismiss the brother duo of which he knew their value in warring times, telling us much about the role they played in Golconda’s survival. But, other members of the royal family failing to understand the intellectual importance of these ministers got them murdered on their way to home during a night. They were able to kill the persons, but the Akkanna-Madanna duo still live on in the memories of local people as heroes who were loyal to their kingdom till their last breath, giving their all to their mother-land. Proceeding further down this path, Nagina Bagh can be seen on the right side.
Nagina Bagh
Taking the path to the right side of the Victoria Cannon, one can reach Nagina Bagh. Nagina Bagh which means “Jewel among the Gardens” has a square layout divided into quadrants by paved pathways converging into a fountain located at the centre of the gardens. Nagina Bagh was the place where the famous Diamond trade used to take place. Merchants from different countries used to come here to buy the diamonds and other valuable stones. A small Mosque can be seen at a corner of Nagina Bagh which was built for the merchants to offer their prayers. When entering the Nagina Bagh following the Victoria Cannon, at the foot of the tree, there is a block of iron weighing more than 200kgs. During Qutb Shahi Period, citizens who lifted this weight using a single hand were eligible for entry in the Sultan's army. This tells us about the fitness level of the Qutb Shahi army and the strict protocol they followed in selecting soldiers. Proceeding further down on the path, stairs which were used by the common people to reach Durbar Hall can be accessed and various other monuments can be seen on the way.
Nagina Mosque
Located at one of the corners of the Nagina Bagh is a small mosque. This mosque was constructed by one of the Sultan's of Golconda for the merchants who used to visit the fort for their trade to offer their prayers.
Lower Tank
Following the path from the Nagina Bagh to the Commoner stairs, one can see the Lower tank on the right side. After the wonderful acoustic system, the clever water supply system of the Qutb Shahis stands out. This ingenious water supply system ensured that tanks in the palace had a continuous supply. Water from a lake named Durgam cheruvu, situated some 5 kilometers away, was transmitted through an open channel using earthen pipes which passed through the Qutb Shahi tombs to the Golconda Fort. This is the first and lower tank which used to collect water from the lake directly. From here, water used to be sent to other tanks using earthen pipes. Water received from the lake was stored in Golconda using an arrangement of three tanks. These three tanks were constructed diagonally with respect to each other up the slope of the hill and simple science was used to automatically pump water from one tank at the foot of the hill to the other tank situated up the hill. These tanks stand today as a proof for the engineering employed while constructing Golconda fort across generations of Qutb Shahi’s.
Commoner Stairs
After passing by Nagina Bagh, following the path, one will reach the foot of a long staircase which will lead the way to the Durbar hall. There are three main staircases to reach the top of Golconda Fort meant for the usage of people based on their social status. This is the staircase which was used by the commoners to reach the Durbar hall to meet the Sultan. This is the longest staircase out of all the staircases. Other monuments like Ramdas Jail, Ambar Khana, Ibrahim Mosque, and MahaKali Temple can be seen while walking down this path before reaching the final destination of Durbar hall.
Middle Tank
This is the second tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the first tank and can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas jail. These tanks have pipes at their bottom and top. Water was filled in these tanks using the pipes connected to the top of these tanks. When the pressure got increased at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of water, pipes at bottom of the tank used to pump water to the next tank.
Upper Tank
This is the third and last tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the second tank and can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas Jail. It is located at a higher altitude relative to all the other tanks in Golconda fort. This tank receives water from the second tank and distributes it to the entire fort. Since, this tank is located at a higher altitude, gravity does all the work in distributing water to all other places in the fort.
Ramdas Jail
Walking down the Commoner stairs and after passing by the Upper Tank, a small door can be seen on a rocky structure on the left side of the stairs. This is where Kancherla Goppana also known as Ramdas was imprisoned by for embezzling Royal funds to build a temple for a Hindu God Ram at Bhadrachalam. Ramdas, was the nephew of the famous brother duo Akkanna-Madanna and worked as a tax collector for one of the Golconda divisions. It is said that on public insistence he constructed temple for Lord Ram, a Hindu deity. When Abul Hasan, the eighth ruler of Golconda got wind of this, he imprisoned Ramdas and declared that he will be released when he pays the entire debt back to kingdom. Ramdas was imprisoned here for Twelve years before getting released. Food was provided to him from the openings in the ceiling. During his imprisonment, Ramdas etched the silhouettes of Hindu Gods Ram along with others on the walls of the prison. These etchings are painted with bright colours to make it easier for the tourists to notice them in the dark. Even to this day, people visiting Ramdas jail offer their prayers to these rock etched silhouettes of Hindu Gods. This structure was believed to be used as part of granary before imprisoning Ramdas. The main granary Ambar Khana is right above this structure.
Ambar Khana
Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana has a Persian inscription on black basalt stating that it was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary used to store food rations for the entire Golconda fort. During the final war with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when Golconda fort was laid a siege, it was not only defences but well planned granaries that helped in survival of Golconda forces.
Ibrahim Mosque
Situated at the upper part of the fort, south-southeast of Baradari, and to the left side of Commoner Stairs, Ibrahim Mosque is a wonderful architectural addition to the Golconda fort. This mosque was built by the fourth king of Golconda, Ibrahim Qutub Shah. Ibrahim mosque was built on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets which are located on the south and north sides, with their bulbous-shaped dome and two balconies. This is an unique style of the medieval Deccan architecture usually found in early Qutb Shahi monuments, the famous one being Charminar. This is a small mosque with three entrances and one span in depth. The entire roof is surrounded by a parapet with battlements. The courtyard of the mosque extends up to the ramparts, providing magnificent views of the landscape below. Ibrahim Mosque is a good example of Qutb Shahi architecture. This simple yet beautiful mosque is marked by three arches with the central being larger than the flanking smaller arches on it’s either sides. At the base it has nine small arches. The external stucco decorations represent typical Qutb Shahi art style.
Sri Jagadamba Mahakali Temple
This is the last structure to be encountered before Durbar Hall while walking by the Commoner Stairs. This is a Hindu temple which belongs to the Kakatiya period. It is carved out of a huge boulder and has colourful frescos of the Goddess Kali on the white-painted facade. This temple is said to be found by some shepherds when roaming around this hill. Taking their advice, the Kakatiyas, the then rulers of Warangal kingdom erected a mud fort around this hill and named this hill as “Golla Konda” meaning “Shepherd’s Kill”. Even after nine hundred years, this temple stands strong. This is a small cave temple and the original idols are kept inside the cave. It is said that Akkanna, the minister of Abul Hasan, the eighth king of Golconda used to offer his prayers at this temple regularly. This temple stands right next to Durbar Hall where King held his official meetings, and also next to Ibrahim Mosque but still, never faced any sort of destruction from Qutb Shahis, which tells us a lot about their respect for all faiths. Being a small temple doesn’t stop thousands of devotees from visiting it each year. The famous festival of Bonalu celebrated by people of Hyderabad in the months of July and August starts from this small cave temple of Mahakali.
Durbar Hall
At the summit of the hill is the three-storeyed breezy Durbar Hall with a rooftop pavilion. Also known as Baradari, this is the highest point in the fort and is also the final destination for people following either Commoner Stairs or Royal Stairs. The ventilation system of the Durbar Hall is absolutely fabulous having exotic designs. They were so intricately designed that cool breeze could reach the interiors of the fort, providing a respite from the heat of summer. At a particular location near this Durbar Hall, one can hear the clapping sound produced at Clapping portico near Balahissar Darwaza. Using this as a means of communication, guards posted at the entrance used to inform the guards at the Durbar Hall about any visitors wanting to meet the king. Durbar Hall is a double-storeyed structure and depending on the social class of visitor, the meeting venue would be decided. The lower storey of the Durbar Hall was used by the king to have audience with general public and the upper storey was used by the king to have private audience with special guests of Golconda, and was known as Diwan-e-Aam. From the roof of Durbar hall, the king used to catch a view of the entire city of Hyderabad. Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda is said to have used to sit on top of this Durbar Hall frequently to watch and hear his favourite courtesan and dancer perform and sing at a Serai, a road-side inn which was constructed by early Qutb Shahi’s, two kilometers away from Golconda fort on the bank of Musi river. This Sarai later got renamed to Taramati Baradari in honour of the dancer, Taramati by Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda. The rumoured secret tunnel from Golconda to Charminar and Gosha Mahal which was said to be designed for the escape of royal family is said to be in Durbar Hall.
Royal Stairs
These are the stairs used by the Royal family to travel from Durbar hall to their palaces. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter compared to the other ones. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals. To keep the palanquins stable horizontally, two of the people carrying used to be tall and the other two used to be short.
Zenana Bodyguards
Coming down the Royal Stairs, the Sultan's palanquin had to pass by this place to reach other structures like Kilwat, Rani Mahal, and Dad Mahal. This is where the Bodyguards guarding the Zenana and the path to Durbar Hall used to have quarters. Since this path was used by the king frequently, and it is the only way to the stairs reaching Durbar Hall, it used to be heavily guarded. These quarters are also close to the mosque used by the ladies of the Imperial Harem to offer their prayers. 
Zenana Mosque
Secluded from other locations and surrounded by walls lies a small mosque near the bodyguard quarters of Zenana. This is a prayer place for the Royal women and other women staying in women's area, the Zenana. Women in imperial harem did not have any restriction on where to pray. But, for women wanting privacy and their own place for worship, this mosque was constructed by Qutb Shahis.
Zenana Dressing Room
Just next to Kilwat, on the right side of it's wall is a Dressing room. This dressing room which was often used by the women in Zenana used to be filled with mirrors, perfumes and other extravagant makeup materials known at that time. There is also a small bathtub present at the middle of the dressing room. This was the same dressing room used by famous dancers Taramati and Premamati who were employed in the court of Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda.
Kilwat
Standing to the front of the Rani Mahal and to the side of Zenana Dressing room lies Kilwat. This is a small two storied chamber specially designed to be the Royal private quarters. The king used to rest here before attending the court at Dad Mahal.
Hall of Whispers
Situated on the ground floor of Rani Mahal, this room was used by the women of the palace to entertain guests. The Sultan sitting in the first floor, to keep tabs on what was discussed, could even listen in on private conversations because the walls were designed to amplify sound to the next floor.
Rani Mahal
Holding precious memories of all the Begums that stayed here, Rani Mahal stands today in a battered position standing between Kilwat and Taramati mosque. The queen of the King of Golconda and other Royal ladies used to stay in these once two-storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. These same walls were also used to be decorated with diamonds and gems before they were plundered by the Mughal army. Rani mahal complex was a two-storeyed structure until it was destroyed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb during his attack on Golconda. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is a Shahi Hammam which survived the onslaught of the Mughal army and was used to serve as Royal Bathtub. Even though mostly destroyed, we could still see the ceramic pipelines, that carried hot and cold water using different passages. It had a separate outlet or drain water to flow out. Among the other things that remain today, a small room still remains intact. This room was used by the King and Queen of Golconda to watch over court proceedings of Dad Mahal and was designed in a way to protect them from unexpected trouble that might arise during a court proceeding.
Dad Mahal
Another live example of the wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda, Dad Mahal lies in between Taramati Mosque and Kilwat. This hall is also known as Hall of Justice. Sultan used to hear grievances of the people and pass judgements on criminals at this place. This hall is filled with porticos. They have been designed in such a way that even a whisper at one end of a portico can be heard from the other end of it. Sultan used to sit on the balcony overseeing the proceedings. This arrangement doesn't allow any commoners to see the Sultan and helped in avoiding assassination attempts that might have happened in the court. Soldiers would collect any document that the people would want to submit to Sultan and drop it in a canister which used to be hung from the first floor by one of the Sultan's servants. These servants used to collect the documents from the canister after pulling it up and read the contents to the Sultan. The person presenting his case had to stand below the portico and speak out his grievance. Standing below the portico and by speaking or even making a sound, one can hear it getting amplified. This eliminated the threat from any concealed weapons which would get their sound amplified while trying to be drawn.
Shahi Hammam
Situated at the first floor of Rani Mahal, this place was a bathtub for Kings and Queens. A portion of water from the tanks was heated up and was routed to the Shahi Hammam. There were different earthen pipes for hot and cold water. Another set of earthen pipes were used to dispose the water from the bath.
Bhagmathi Palace
Standing to the left side of Dad Mahal and right side of Stable, lie Bhagmathi Palace. This palace was said to be built by Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth king of Golconda for his lover Bhagmathi. The king also built a city and named after her as Bhagyanagar which later changed to Hyderabad.
Stable
This place lies next to the inner Fort wall right next to the left side of Bhagmati Palace. This Stable was used to keep Camels and Elephants.
Taramathi Mosque
Situated right next to Nakkar Khana is a mosque. This mosque is said to be dedicated tothe dancer and queen Taramati who was employed in the royal court of Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda. 
Nakkar Khana
While walking by Aslah Khana, an open space can be seen on it's right side. This was where the Drum bearers used to perform during festivals and ceremonies.
Aslah Khana
Also called as Silah Khana, This place was used as armoury during Qutub Shahi times. It is said to have around 150 rooms. Some of the long cannons with quite a few cannon balls are displayed in one of the large arched windows here. Since Silah Khana is an essential structure to fort defences, it is situated close to Balahissar gate.
Dhobhi Ghat
Dhobhi Ghat is located in the farthest corner of the inner fort which is currently inaccessible. All the clothes of the royal family used to be washed here.
Sultan Quli Qutb Shah Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was the first king and founder of Golconda Kingdom and ruled from 1518 A.D. to 1543 A.D. It is said that he was a Turk and arrived in the Deccan, now a part of India, along with his family around the middle of the fifteenth century. He joined as the bodyguard of the Bahmani king and later got appointed as Accountant General of the Imperial Harem at Telangana. He was called Sultan Quli while in Bahmani court. Here Sultan is not a royal title rather the name Sultan Quli get’s translated to “servant of king”, as Quli is a Turki word meaning servant. In 1495, Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was awarded the title of Amir-ul-Umra for saving the king of Bahmani empire from assassination and was appointed the governor of the Telangana district whose headquarters were at Golconda. When Mahmood Shah Bahmani, the ruler of Bahmani Kingdom died in 1518, Sultan Quli assumed independence as Sultan Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda. By this time he had already replaced the mud fort of Golconda by a substantial fortress of stone. Sultan Quli’s first campaign as King was against Krishna Deva Raya of the Vijayanagar Kingdom where he captured some forts. During his long reign, the king was in almost ceaseless warfare as a result of which the boundaries of Golconda kingdom expanded. Sultan Quli beautified his fortress with mosques, palaces and gardens. Sultan Quli’s elder son had died during his reign and his second son Khutb-ud-din was blinded by the third son Jamshed for which he was imprisoned. Jamshed, while imprisoned in jail is said to have instigated Mir Muhammad Hamidani, the governor of Golconda, to kill the king. While praying in the principal mosque, the Jami Masjid, in September 1543, Sultan Quli on his 99th year was murdered by getting stabbed. Sultan Quli reigned for 48 years, 23 as governor and 25 as King of Golconda.
Jamshed Qutb Shah Jamshed Qutb Shah ascended the throne on the death of his father in 1543 A.D. One of his first acts was to try to seize his younger brother Ibrahim, who was governor of one of the Telangana forts. Ibrahim fled to Bidar and later found shelter at Vijaynagar, where the Great Rama Raya was reigning. Soon after Jamshed's accession Ali Barid, king of Bidar waged war against Golconda. He was within seven miles of the fort before Jamshed knew of his coming. Immediately Jamshed collected a force and marched on Bidar, forcing Ali Barad to withdraw to save his own capital. Jamshed was a warlike ruler and a man of considerable sagacity. He interfered far more than was the custom with his successors in conflicts between the sultans of Deccan. During his reign he bore a part in various quarrels between the kings of Ahmednagar, Bidar and Bijapur, his clever diplomacy invariably guiding him to espouse the cause of the winning side. He was also a poet. About two years before he died Jamshed was stricken with cancer. During the end of his reign, many paid the maximum penalty for the most trivial offences. Jamshed died early in 1550 A.D., after reigning nearly seven years.
Subhan Quli Qutb Shah When Jamshed died, his son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah, seven years old, was placed on the throne. His exit from the arena of history is as premature as his entrance into it. After being on the throne for about six months he passes out of our knowledge completely. His death is not recorded, nor is it known where he was buried.
Sultan Ibrahim Qutb Shah When Subhan Quli ascended the throne, his uncle, Prince Ibrahim was a fugitive at Vijaynagar. When the regent of Subhan Quli aspired to the crown and became so powerful and overbearing, some of the nobles made secret overtures to Prince Ibrahim, inviting him to court. With the help from Naikwaris, the Hindu soldiers garrisoned at Golconda, Prince Ibrahim defeated the regent and entered Golconda. He was crowned as King Ibrahim Qutb Shah on the 27th July 1550, when he was twenty years old. Jagdeo Rai, the leader of the Naikwaris who was made prime minister in the court of Sultan Ibrahim, planned to dethrone Ibrahim. When this plan was found out, he fled to Berar and finally reached Vijayanagar kingdom. Since the advent of Jagdeo Rai at Vijayanagar, friendly relations between Golconda and Vijayanagar gradually became strained and finally broke under the pressure of aggression. Vijayanagar at that time was a very powerful kingdom. Under the leadership of the king of Bijapur, but through the mediation of the king of Golconda, a league of the faithful was formed against Vijayanagar, consisting of the four Muhammadan States of Ahmednagar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. The armies of the league marched out from the plains of Bijapur on the 24th December 1564, and on the 24th January 1565, the decisive battle known as the battle of Talikot was fought. It destroyed the great Hindu empire of Vijayanagar and it's capital Hampi was plundered and burned for five months. Ibrahim Qutb Shah strengthened the fortifications around the hill with stone and mortar, and at his invitation, many of the nobles constructed buildings within the walls. Beside several mosques and schools, Ibrahim built the Langar house at Golconda and planted the Ibrahim Bagh at the site of the tombs. To him, we owe the very pleasure of the Husain Sagar tank which was built under the king's orders in 1575 by Husain Shah Wali, and was supposed to be named Ibrahim Sagar. But due to the popularity of Husain Shah Wali, the tank was named as Hussain Sagar by the people. Ibrahim Qutb Shah established security and encouraged able characters at his court. Golconda became a market for the whole world during his reign. and merchants from other countries were so well treated that they returned frequently. Ibrahim Qutb Shah died on the 2nd June 1580. His third son, Muhammad Quli succeeded to the throne.
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was born on the 8th April 1566 and ascended the throne on the death of his father in 1580. During his long, peaceful and prosperous reign the dynasty reached its zenith. The time which his predecessors gave for the battlefield, he devoted to the improvement and embellishment of his capital. As time passed, Golconda became very unhealthy through over-population, and in 1591 the king built a magnificent city a few miles away, which he named Bhagnagar to commemorate his favorite mistress, Bhagmati. After her death, the king was persuaded to change the name of the city to Haidarabad which changed to Hyderabad with the passage of time. In the new city, which was laid out on the "gridiron" principle, there were two important crossings over the main road. At the junction with the road from Golconda, Muhammad Quli built the Char Minar in 1593, and at the crossing to Masulipatam, he erected the Gulzar Hauz. In the same year, the Purana Pul was built. Muhammad Quli also built the Dar-us-Shifa and in 1594 commenced the Ashur Khana. In 1598 the Jami Masjid was erected near the Char Minar. The Dad Mahal was built about the same time. Several palaces were erected, e. g. the Chandav Mahal, Hira Mahal, Lakhan Mahal, and the Nadi Mahal. Only the names of many of these remain today. Muhammad Quli made extensive additions to the fort of Golconda. During his reign, Kurnool, Nandial, Dole, Gandikota and Kadapa in the south were added to the Golconda dominions and inroads were made into the eastern districts of Nellore. In 1611, the first venture on behalf of the East India Company was made in his time at Masulipatam. Muhammad Quli apart from being a just and capable king was also a poet. He died after a brief illness, in the thirty-second year of his reign, on the 17th December 1611. 
Muhammad Qutb Shah As Muhammad Quli left no son to inherit, the next king was his nephew, Muhammad Qutb Shah, son of Muhammad Arain, who was the sixth son of King Ibrahim Qutb Shah. Muhammad Qutb Shah was also the son-in-law of the late king, having married his daughter Hayat Baksh Begum. Muhammad Qutb Shah was born in April 1593 and ascended the throne of Golconda on the 17th December 1611. His reign of fourteen years was uneventful, it was the lull before the storm. He was a historian and philosopher, and although he did not neglect the duties of his kingly office, most of his time was spent in study and exchanges with the learned men whom he encouraged at his court. The Qutb Shah chronicles were compiled during his reign. He laid out some gardens to add to the beauty of his capital, but his principal undertaking was the foundation of the Mecca Masjid in the city of Hyderabad, leaving the building to be continued by his successors. In Muhammad Qutb Shah's reign, the Dutch established themselves at Machilipatnam 1615 and the English in 1622. Muhammad Qutb Shah died on the 11th February 1626.
Abdulla Qutb Shah Muhammad Qutb Shah's son Abdulla ascended the throne on the death of his father in a time of great difficulties for the Qutb dynasty. It was in his time that the Mughals commenced experimenting in the two directions of local authority and federal harmony. Under his rule, The English got to establish their trade at the port of Machilipatnam. In 1655-56, a rupture occurred between the king and his minister, Mir Jumla. Mir Jumla appealed to the Mughal prince Aurangzeb for protection. Aurangzeb exfoliated an ordinary incident into a series of imposing mysteries. He made Mir Jumla a commander of 5,000 horse and his son, Muhammad Amin, a commander of 2,000 horse in the Imperial service. Thereupon Aurangzeb dispatched armies to capture Golconda in 1656. The siege had not lasted long before orders arrived from Delhi, from the Emperor Shah Jahan, to suspend hostilities. King Abdulla like a wise man, was glad to buy off the Mughals with a promise to pay a heavy indemnity to cover the cost of the expedition and to clear arrears of tribute, but the principal condition of the treaty was the marriage of his second daughter to the Imperial prince, Muhammad Sultan, and the recognition of the latter as the heir-apparent to the throne of Golconda. It is said that Mir Jumla, when defected to Mughals, presented the Emperor Shah Jahan with a magnificent diamond, believed to be the Koh-i-noor. After the attack by the Mughal army, Abdulla Qutb Shah added largely to the defenses of the fort. Naya Qila, the eastern portion of the fort was built by him to take in a hillock which gives the holder some advantage over the fortress. Abdulla Qutb Shah was a just and liberal prince, but he was not shrewd enough for his time. Being an enthusiastic patron of learning and architecture, he founded many colleges. He also built several mosques, including the Toli Masjid, palaces, baths, and gardens. Work on the Mecca Masjid seems to have languished, if it did not stop, during his reign. Abdulla Qutb Shall died on the 1st May 1672. He left no sons but had three daughters. The husband of the third daughter, Abul Hasan succeeded him to the throne.
Abul Hasan After Abdulla Qutb Shah's death in 1672, his youngest son-in-law, Abul Hasan ascended the throne and entrusted the affairs of state to his Prime Minister Madanna. In 1683 Emperor Aurangzeb collected all the forces of the empire to make one grand and final attack upon the Deccan and reconquer it after a fitful series of wars begun by his Great Grandfather, Akbar. Aurangzeb marched at the head of what is known as the Grand Army. Aurangzeb warned Abul Hasan not to interfere and Abul Hasan not heeding the warning wrote to Bijapur the only other Deccan Sultanate standing, proposing to send 40,000 men to his help and to secure the assistance of Marathi leader, Sambha Ji. The letter fell into the hands of Aurangzeb and he immediately detached Prince Shah Alam with a large army to march on Golconda. Abul Hasan lost in this battle when Aurangzeb arrived on the battlefield with his main army and some heavy terms were imposed on him which also contain the orders for the dismissal of Madanna and Akkanna along with others. Abul Hasan put off the dismissal of Madanna and Akkanna until the discontented nobles, who regarded these men as the cause of all their misfortunes, lost all patience and murdered these brothers.   The dowager queen sent the heads of Madanna and Akkanna to Aurangzeb as a peace offering and Abul Hasan had a brief respite until Bijapur fell. But nothing could shake off Aurangzeb's determination to end Abul Hasan's rule resulting in him attacking Golconda in 1687. When Aurangzeb attacked Golconda, Abul Hasan fled to his fort and the city was occupied by the Mughals for the third time, under Ghazi-ud-din Firoz Jung, the father of the first Nizam. With the whole might of the Mughal Empire at his back, Aurangzeb beat incessantly for eight months against Golconda's fortifications with no results. Abdulla Khan Pani, a general in Golconda's army was bribed to open Golconda's gate allowing the Mughal army to pass through Fateh Darwaza at midnight. After a long siege of eight months, the kingdom of Golconda fell, not due to force but treachery. Abul Hasan was taken a prisoner and was sent to Daulatabad to spend the rest of his life. He was allotted Chini Mahal where he stayed, until his death in 1704 A.D. and was buried at Roza.
