Situated at the upper part of the fort, south-southeast of Baradari, and to the left side of Commoner Stairs, Ibrahim Mosque is a wonderful architectural addition to the Golconda fort. This mosque was built by the fourth king of Golconda, Ibrahim Qutub Shah. Ibrahim mosque was built on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets which are located on the south and north sides, with their bulbous-shaped dome and two balconies. This is an unique style of the medieval Deccan architecture usually found in early Qutb Shahi monuments, the famous one being Charminar. This is a small mosque with three entrances and one span in depth. The entire roof is surrounded by a parapet with battlements. The courtyard of the mosque extends up to the ramparts, providing magnificent views of the landscape below. Ibrahim Mosque is a good example of Qutb Shahi architecture. This simple yet beautiful mosque is marked by three arches with the central being larger than the flanking smaller arches on itâ€™s either sides. At the base it has nine small arches. The external stucco decorations represent typical Qutb Shahi art style.
