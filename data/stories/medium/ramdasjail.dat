Walking down the Commoner stairs and after passing by the Upper Tank, a small door can be seen on a rocky structure on the left side of the stairs. This is where Kancherla Goppana also known as Ramdas was imprisoned by for embezzling Royal funds to build a temple for a Hindu God Ram at Bhadrachalam. Ramdas, was the nephew of the famous brother duo Akkanna-Madanna and worked as a tax collector for one of the Golconda divisions. It is said that on public insistence he constructed temple for Lord Ram, a Hindu deity. When Abul Hasan, the eighth ruler of Golconda got wind of this, he imprisoned Ramdas and declared that he will be released when he pays the entire debt back to kingdom. Ramdas was imprisoned here for Twelve years before getting released. Food was provided to him from the openings in the ceiling. During his imprisonment, Ramdas etched the silhouettes of Hindu Gods Ram along with others on the walls of the prison. These etchings are painted with bright colours to make it easier for the tourists to notice them in the dark. Even to this day, people visiting Ramdas jail offer their prayers to these rock etched silhouettes of Hindu Gods. This structure was believed to be used as part of granary before imprisoning Ramdas. The main granary Ambar Khana is right above this structure. Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana has a Persian inscription on black basalt stating that it was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary used to store food rations for the entire Golconda fort. During the final war with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when Golconda fort was laid a siege, it was not only defences but well planned granaries that helped in survival of Golconda forces.
