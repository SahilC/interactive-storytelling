Situated on the ground floor of Rani Mahal, this room was used by the women of the palace to entertain guests. The Sultan sitting in the first floor, to keep tabs on what was discussed, could even listen in on private conversations because the walls were designed to amplify sound to the next floor. Holding precious memories of all the Begums that stayed here, Rani Mahal stands today in a battered position standing between Kilwat and Taramati mosque. The queen of the King of Golconda and other Royal ladies used to stay in these once two-storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. These same walls were also used to be decorated with diamonds and gems before they were plundered by the Mughal army. Rani mahal complex was a two-storeyed structure until it was destroyed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb during his attack on Golconda. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is a Shahi Hammam which survived the onslaught of the Mughal army and was used to serve as Royal Bathtub. Even though mostly destroyed, we could still see the ceramic pipelines, that carried hot and cold water using different passages. It had a separate outlet or drain water to flow out. Among the other things that remain today, a small room still remains intact. This room was used by the King and Queen of Golconda to watch over court proceedings of Dad Mahal and was designed in a way to protect them from unexpected trouble that might arise during a court proceeding. Situated at the first floor of Rani Mahal, this place was a bathtub for Kings and Queens. A portion of water from the tanks was heated up and was routed to the Shahi Hammam. There were different earthen pipes for hot and cold water. Another set of earthen pipes were used to dispose the water from the bath.
