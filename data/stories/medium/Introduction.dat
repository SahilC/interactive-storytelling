Welcome to Golconda. Sultan Quli was the first ruler to rule over this place. He fortified the inner structure of the mud fort which stood here. His son, Ibhrahim Quli, further strengthened it and constructed the inner places, moques and other buldings. You can still see the splendour that was here. The strong shia following and lineage with Persia encouraged the constant influx of Persians who made a strong impact on all walks of life and culture. During the Qutub Shahi rule of 175 lunar years, Golconda and Hyderabad blossomed with activities of trade and culture. Very soon, Golconda became a hub of composite culture with unique architecture and monuments of a distinct Qutub Shahi style, a fusuion of Indian and Persian styles.
