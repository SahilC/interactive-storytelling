By the time of Ibrahim Qutb Shah, the fourth king of Golconda, the kingdom got stabilized and the Kings undertook various construction programmes across Golconda. Ibrahim Qutb Shah strengthened the fortifications around the hill with stone and mortar, and at his invitation many of the nobles constructed buildings within the walls. Beside several mosques and schools he built Ibrahim Tank, Husain Sagar Tank, Ibrahim Bagh near Qutb Shahi Tombs and Langar House at Golconda. To cater for the needs of growing population of Golconda, Mahomed Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth king of Golconda constructed a new city in 1591 and named it Bhagyanagar after hs favourite mistress Bhagmati. In 1593, Char Minar along with Purana Pul were built. Mohamed Quli built Dar-us-Shifa and in 94 commenced the Ashur Khana, which stands opposite to Salar Jung Palace. In 1598, the jami Masjid was erected near the Charminar. The Dad Mahal or the Hall of Justice was also built around 1598. Out of many constructions that were taken by Qutb Shahis, only few remain today and the rest have been eradicated by the ruthless hands of time. Mohamed Qutb Shah, the sixth king of Golconda laid foundation to the Mecca Masjid of Hyderabad and left the building to be continued by his successors.
