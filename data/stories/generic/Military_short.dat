One of the regular military exercises was called “The ceremony of mounting guard”. Every monday nobles of Golconda mount guard each in his turn and were relieved at the end of the week. When they mount guard, each goes from his home to the rendezvous. From there, they march in good order across the bridge and from then by the main street they assemble in the square in front of the Fort balcony.
