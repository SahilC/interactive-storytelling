 During the reign of Ibrahim Qutb Shah, the fourth King of Golconda became a market for the whole world. Merchants from Turkey, Arabia, and Persia were so well treated that they used to visit Golconda frequently. During Mohamed Qutb Shahâ€™s time, the Dutch established themselves at Machilipatnam in 1615 and the English in 1622.
