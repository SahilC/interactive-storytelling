The Qutb shahi kingdom undertook various construction programmes across Golconda. Ibrahim Qutb Shah strengthened the fortifications around the hill with stone and mortar, and many of the nobles constructed buildings within the walls. Beside several mosques and schools he built Ibrahim Tank, Husain Sagar Tank, Ibrahim Bagh near Qutb Shahi Tombs and Langar House at Golconda. Mahomed Quli Qutb Shah constructed Bhagyanagar after his favourite mistress Bhagmati. The jami Masjid was erected near the Charminar. The Dad Mahal or the Hall of Justice was also built around 1598. Out of many constructions that were taken by Qutb Shahis, only few remain today. Mohamed Qutb Shah, the sixth king of Golconda laid foundation to the Mecca Masjid of Hyderabad.
