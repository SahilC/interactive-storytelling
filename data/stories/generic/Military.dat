One of the regular military exercises was called “The ceremony of mounting guard”. Every monday nobles of Golconda mount guard each in his turn and were relieved at the end of the week. Some of these nobles commanded a few thousand horses and they encamped under their tents around the town. When they mount guard, each goes from his home to the rendezvous. From there, they march in good order across the bridge and from then by the main street they assemble in the square in front of the Fort balcony. In the vanguard, ten or twelve elephants can be seen marching, more or fewer according to the rank of him who goes off guard. Some among these Elephants used to carry howdas which were used to carry more people and there were others which only carried their driver and another man instead of the howdas, who used to hold a sort of banner. After the elephants, the camels followed two by two, sometimes up to thirty or forty. Each camel had its saddle, upon which they placed a small culverin (a long slender gun), which a man, clad in a skin from head to foot, like a sort of pantaloon, and seated in the crupper of the camel with a lighted match in hand, quickly turns from side to side before the balcony where the King is. Following them were the carriages, around which the servants walked on foot, after which the led‐horses appeared and finally the noble to whom this whole equipment belongs, preceded by ten or twelve courtesans, who awaited him at the end of the bridge, leaping and dancing before him up to the square. After him the cavalry and infantry follow in good order. For the people watching this ceremony that afforded a spectacle and had something of pomp about it.
