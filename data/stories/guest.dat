Taking the path straight from Clapping Portico and passing by Victoria Cannon, one can reach the pathway with Guest Rooms on the left side which are built below the ground level. This is where the royal guests used to stay. A mosque was built for the guests to offer their prayers. Further down this path are Akkana-Madanna Office quarters.
