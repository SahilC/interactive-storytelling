When Subhan Quli ascended the throne, his uncle, Prince Ibrahim was a fugitive at Vijaynagar. When the regent of Subhan Quli aspired to the crown and became so powerful and overbearing, some of the nobles made secret overtures to Prince Ibrahim, inviting him to court. With the help from Naikwaris, the Hindu soldiers garrisoned at Golconda, Prince Ibrahim defeated the regent and entered Golconda. He was crowned as King Ibrahim Qutb Shah on the 27th July 1550, when he was twenty years old. Jagdeo Rai, the leader of the Naikwaris who was made prime minister in the court of Sultan Ibrahim, planned to dethrone Ibrahim. When this plan was found out, he fled to Berar and finally reached Vijayanagar kingdom. Since the advent of Jagdeo Rai at Vijayanagar, friendly relations between Golconda and Vijayanagar gradually became strained and finally broke under the pressure of aggression. Vijayanagar at that time was a very powerful kingdom. Under the leadership of the king of Bijapur, but through the mediation of the king of Golconda, a league of the faithful was formed against Vijayanagar, consisting of the four Muhammadan States of Ahmednagar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. The armies of the league marched out from the plains of Bijapur on the 24th December 1564, and on the 24th January 1565, the decisive battle known as the battle of Talikot was fought. It destroyed the great Hindu empire of Vijayanagar and it's capital Hampi was plundered and burned for five months. Ibrahim Qutb Shah strengthened the fortifications around the hill with stone and mortar, and at his invitation, many of the nobles constructed buildings within the walls. Beside several mosques and schools, Ibrahim built the Langar house at Golconda and planted the Ibrahim Bagh at the site of the tombs. To him, we owe the very pleasure of the Husain Sagar tank which was built under the king's orders in 1575 by Husain Shah Wali, and was supposed to be named Ibrahim Sagar. But due to the popularity of Husain Shah Wali, the tank was named as Hussain Sagar by the people. Ibrahim Qutb Shah established security and encouraged able characters at his court. Golconda became a market for the whole world during his reign. and merchants from other countries were so well treated that they returned frequently. Ibrahim Qutb Shah died on the 2nd June 1580. His third son, Muhammad Quli succeeded to the throne.
