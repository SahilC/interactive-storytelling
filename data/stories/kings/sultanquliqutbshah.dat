Sultan Quli Qutb Shah(1518 A.D-1543 A.D.)
Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was the first king and founder of Golconda Kingdom and ruled from 1518 A.D. to 1543 A.D. It is said that he was a Turk and arrived in the Deccan, now a part of India, along with his family around the middle of the fifteenth century. He joined as the bodyguard of the Bahmani king and later got appointed as Accountant General of the Imperial Harem at Telangana. He was called Sultan Quli while in Bahmani court. Here Sultan is not a royal title rather the name Sultan Quli get’s translated to “servant of king”, as Quli is a Turki word meaning servant. In 1495, Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was awarded the title of Amir-ul-Umra for saving the king of Bahmani empire from assassination and was appointed the governor of the Telangana district whose headquarters were at Golconda. When Mahmood Shah Bahmani, the ruler of Bahmani Kingdom died in 1518, Sultan Quli assumed independence as Sultan Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda. By this time he had already replaced the mud fort of Golconda by a substantial fortress of stone. Sultan Quli’s first campaign as King was against Krishna Deva Raya of the Vijayanagar Kingdom where he captured some forts. During his long reign, the king was in almost ceaseless warfare as a result of which the boundaries of Golconda kingdom expanded. Sultan Quli beautified his fortress with mosques, palaces and gardens. Sultan Quli’s elder son had died during his reign and his second son Khutb-ud-din was blinded by the third son Jamshed for which he was imprisoned. Jamshed, while imprisoned in jail is said to have instigated Mir Muhammad Hamidani, the governor of Golconda, to kill the king. While praying in the principal mosque, the Jami Masjid, in September 1543, Sultan Quli on his 99th year was murdered by getting stabbed. Sultan Quli reigned for 48 years, 23 as governor and 25 as King of Golconda.
