Muhammad Qutb Shah's son Abdulla ascended the throne on the death of his father in a time of great difficulties for the Qutb dynasty. It was in his time that the Mughals commenced experimenting in the two directions of local authority and federal harmony. Under his rule, The English got to establish their trade at the port of Machilipatnam. In 1655-56, a rupture occurred between the king and his minister, Mir Jumla. Mir Jumla appealed to the Mughal prince Aurangzeb for protection. Aurangzeb exfoliated an ordinary incident into a series of imposing mysteries. He made Mir Jumla a commander of 5,000 horse and his son, Muhammad Amin, a commander of 2,000 horse in the Imperial service. Thereupon Aurangzeb dispatched armies to capture Golconda in 1656. The siege had not lasted long before orders arrived from Delhi, from the Emperor Shah Jahan, to suspend hostilities. King Abdulla like a wise man, was glad to buy off the Mughals with a promise to pay a heavy indemnity to cover the cost of the expedition and to clear arrears of tribute, but the principal condition of the treaty was the marriage of his second daughter to the Imperial prince, Muhammad Sultan, and the recognition of the latter as the heir-apparent to the throne of Golconda. It is said that Mir Jumla, when defected to Mughals, presented the Emperor Shah Jahan with a magnificent diamond, believed to be the Koh-i-noor. After the attack by the Mughal army, Abdulla Qutb Shah added largely to the defenses of the fort. Naya Qila, the eastern portion of the fort was built by him to take in a hillock which gives the holder some advantage over the fortress. Abdulla Qutb Shah was a just and liberal prince, but he was not shrewd enough for his time. Being an enthusiastic patron of learning and architecture, he founded many colleges. He also built several mosques, including the Toli Masjid, palaces, baths, and gardens. Work on the Mecca Masjid seems to have languished, if it did not stop, during his reign. Abdulla Qutb Shall died on the 1st May 1672. He left no sons but had three daughters. The husband of the third daughter, Abul Hasan succeeded him to the throne.
