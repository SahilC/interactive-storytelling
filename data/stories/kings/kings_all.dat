Sultan Quli Qutb Shah(1518 A.D-1543 A.D.)
Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was the first king and founder of Golconda Kingdom and ruled from 1518 A.D. to 1543 A.D. It is said that he was a Turk and arrived in the Deccan, now a part of India, along with his family around the middle of the fifteenth century. He joined as the bodyguard of the Bahmani king and later got appointed as Accountant General of the Imperial Harem at Telangana. He was called Sultan Quli while in Bahmani court. Here Sultan is not a royal title rather the name Sultan Quli get’s translated to “servant of king”, as Quli is a Turki word meaning servant. In 1495, Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was awarded the title of Amir-ul-Umra for saving the king of Bahmani empire from assassination and was appointed the governor of the Telangana district whose headquarters were at Golconda. When Mahmood Shah Bahmani, the ruler of Bahmani Kingdom died in 1518, Sultan Quli assumed independence as Sultan Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda. By this time he had already replaced the mud fort of Golconda by a substantial fortress of stone. Sultan Quli’s first campaign as King was against Krishna Deva Raya of the Vijayanagar Kingdom where he captured some forts. During his long reign, the king was in almost ceaseless warfare as a result of which the boundaries of Golconda kingdom expanded. Sultan Quli beautified his fortress with mosques, palaces and gardens. Sultan Quli’s elder son had died during his reign and his second son Khutb-ud-din was blinded by the third son Jamshed for which he was imprisoned. Jamshed, while imprisoned in jail is said to have instigated Mir Muhammad Hamidani, the governor of Golconda, to kill the king. While praying in the principal mosque, the Jami Masjid, in September 1543, Sultan Quli on his 99th year was murdered by getting stabbed. Sultan Quli reigned for 48 years, 23 as governor and 25 as King of Golconda.
Jamshed Qutb Shah(1543 A.D-1550 A.D.)
Jamshed Qutb Shah ascended the throne on the death of his father in 1543 A.D. One of his first acts was to try to seize his younger brother Ibrahim, who was governor of one of the Telangana forts. Ibrahim fled to Bidar and later found shelter at Vijaynagar, where the Great Rama Raya was reigning. Soon after Jamshed's accession Ali Barid, king of Bidar waged war against Golconda. He was within seven miles of the fort before Jamshed knew of his coming. Immediately Jamshed collected a force and marched on Bidar, forcing Ali Barad to withdraw to save his own capital. Jamshed was a warlike ruler and a man of considerable sagacity. He interfered far more than was the custom with his successors in conflicts between the sultans of Deccan. During his reign he bore a part in various quarrels between the kings of Ahmednagar, Bidar and Bijapur, his clever diplomacy invariably guiding him to espouse the cause of the winning side. He was also a poet. About two years before he died Jamshed was stricken with cancer. During the end of his reign, many paid the maximum penalty for the most trivial offences. Jamshed died early in 1550 A.D., after reigning nearly seven years.
Subhan Quli Qutb Shah(1550 A.D.-1550 A.D.)
When Jamshed died, his son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah, seven years old, was placed on the throne. His exit from the arena of history is as premature as his entrance into it. After being on the throne for about six months he passes out of our knowledge completely. His death is not recorded, nor is it known where he was buried.
Sultan Ibrahim Qutb Shah(1550 A.D.-1580A.D.)
When Subhan Quli ascended the throne, his uncle, Prince Ibrahim was a fugitive at Vijaynagar. When the regent of Subhan Quli aspired to the crown and became so powerful and overbearing, some of the nobles made secret overtures to Prince Ibrahim, inviting him to court. With the help from Naikwaris, the Hindu soldiers garrisoned at Golconda, Prince Ibrahim defeated the regent and entered Golconda. He was crowned as King Ibrahim Qutb Shah on the 27th July 1550, when he was twenty years old. Jagdeo Rai, the leader of the Naikwaris who was made prime minister in the court of Sultan Ibrahim, planned to dethrone Ibrahim. When this plan was found out, he fled to Berar and finally reached Vijayanagar kingdom. Since the advent of Jagdeo Rai at Vijayanagar, friendly relations between Golconda and Vijayanagar gradually became strained and finally broke under the pressure of aggression. Vijayanagar at that time was a very powerful kingdom. Under the leadership of the king of Bijapur, but through the mediation of the king of Golconda, a league of the faithful was formed against Vijayanagar, consisting of the four Muhammadan States of Ahmednagar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. The armies of the league marched out from the plains of Bijapur on the 24th December 1564, and on the 24th January 1565, the decisive battle known as the battle of Talikot was fought. It destroyed the great Hindu empire of Vijayanagar and it's capital Hampi was plundered and burned for five months. Ibrahim Qutb Shah strengthened the fortifications around the hill with stone and mortar, and at his invitation, many of the nobles constructed buildings within the walls. Beside several mosques and schools, Ibrahim built the Langar house at Golconda and planted the Ibrahim Bagh at the site of the tombs. To him, we owe the very pleasure of the Husain Sagar tank which was built under the king's orders in 1575 by Husain Shah Wali, and was supposed to be named Ibrahim Sagar. But due to the popularity of Husain Shah Wali, the tank was named as Hussain Sagar by the people. Ibrahim Qutb Shah established security and encouraged able characters at his court. Golconda became a market for the whole world during his reign. and merchants from other countries were so well treated that they returned frequently. Ibrahim Qutb Shah died on the 2nd June 1580. His third son, Muhammad Quli succeeded to the throne.
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah(1580 A.D-1611 A.D.)
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was born on the 8th April 1566 and ascended the throne on the death of his father in 1580. During his long, peaceful and prosperous reign the dynasty reached its zenith. The time which his predecessors gave for the battlefield, he devoted to the improvement and embellishment of his capital. As time passed, Golconda became very unhealthy through over-population, and in 1591 the king built a magnificent city a few miles away, which he named Bhagnagar to commemorate his favorite mistress, Bhagmati. After her death, the king was persuaded to change the name of the city to Haidarabad which changed to Hyderabad with the passage of time. In the new city, which was laid out on the "gridiron" principle, there were two important crossings over the main road. At the junction with the road from Golconda, Muhammad Quli built the Char Minar in 1593, and at the crossing to Masulipatam, he erected the Gulzar Hauz. In the same year, the Purana Pul was built. Muhammad Quli also built the Dar-us-Shifa and in 1594 commenced the Ashur Khana. In 1598 the Jami Masjid was erected near the Char Minar. The Dad Mahal was built about the same time. Several palaces were erected, e. g. the Chandav Mahal, Hira Mahal, Lakhan Mahal, and the Nadi Mahal. Only the names of many of these remain today. Muhammad Quli made extensive additions to the fort of Golconda. During his reign, Kurnool, Nandial, Dole, Gandikota and Kadapa in the south were added to the Golconda dominions and inroads were made into the eastern districts of Nellore. In 1611, the first venture on behalf of the East India Company was made in his time at Masulipatam. Muhammad Quli apart from being a just and capable king was also a poet. He died after a brief illness, in the thirty-second year of his reign, on the 17th December 1611. 
Muhammad Qutb Shah(1611 A.D.-1626A.D.)
As Muhammad Quli left no son to inherit, the next king was his nephew, Muhammad Qutb Shah, son of Muhammad Arain, who was the sixth son of King Ibrahim Qutb Shah. Muhammad Qutb Shah was also the son-in-law of the late king, having married his daughter Hayat Baksh Begum. Muhammad Qutb Shah was born in April 1593 and ascended the throne of Golconda on the 17th December 1611. His reign of fourteen years was uneventful, it was the lull before the storm. He was a historian and philosopher, and although he did not neglect the duties of his kingly office, most of his time was spent in study and exchanges with the learned men whom he encouraged at his court. The Qutb Shah chronicles were compiled during his reign. He laid out some gardens to add to the beauty of his capital, but his principal undertaking was the foundation of the Mecca Masjid in the city of Hyderabad, leaving the building to be continued by his successors. In Muhammad Qutb Shah's reign, the Dutch established themselves at Machilipatnam 1615 and the English in 1622. Muhammad Qutb Shah died on the 11th February 1626.
Abdulla Qutb Shah(1626A.D.-1672A.D.)
Muhammad Qutb Shah's son Abdulla ascended the throne on the death of his father in a time of great difficulties for the Qutb dynasty. It was in his time that the Mughals commenced experimenting in the two directions of local authority and federal harmony. Under his rule, The English got to establish their trade at the port of Machilipatnam. In 1655-56, a rupture occurred between the king and his minister, Mir Jumla. Mir Jumla appealed to the Mughal prince Aurangzeb for protection. Aurangzeb exfoliated an ordinary incident into a series of imposing mysteries. He made Mir Jumla a commander of 5,000 horse and his son, Muhammad Amin, a commander of 2,000 horse in the Imperial service. Thereupon Aurangzeb dispatched armies to capture Golconda in 1656. The siege had not lasted long before orders arrived from Delhi, from the Emperor Shah Jahan, to suspend hostilities. King Abdulla like a wise man, was glad to buy off the Mughals with a promise to pay a heavy indemnity to cover the cost of the expedition and to clear arrears of tribute, but the principal condition of the treaty was the marriage of his second daughter to the Imperial prince, Muhammad Sultan, and the recognition of the latter as the heir-apparent to the throne of Golconda. It is said that Mir Jumla, when defected to Mughals, presented the Emperor Shah Jahan with a magnificent diamond, believed to be the Koh-i-noor. After the attack by the Mughal army, Abdulla Qutb Shah added largely to the defenses of the fort. Naya Qila, the eastern portion of the fort was built by him to take in a hillock which gives the holder some advantage over the fortress. Abdulla Qutb Shah was a just and liberal prince, but he was not shrewd enough for his time. Being an enthusiastic patron of learning and architecture, he founded many colleges. He also built several mosques, including the Toli Masjid, palaces, baths, and gardens. Work on the Mecca Masjid seems to have languished, if it did not stop, during his reign. Abdulla Qutb Shall died on the 1st May 1672. He left no sons but had three daughters. The husband of the third daughter, Abul Hasan succeeded him to the throne.
Abul Hasan(1672A.D-1687A.D.)
After Abdulla Qutb Shah's death in 1672, his youngest son-in-law, Abul Hasan ascended the throne and entrusted the affairs of state to his Prime Minister Madanna. In 1683 Emperor Aurangzeb collected all the forces of the empire to make one grand and final attack upon the Deccan and reconquer it after a fitful series of wars begun by his Great Grandfather, Akbar. Aurangzeb marched at the head of what is known as the Grand Army. Aurangzeb warned Abul Hasan not to interfere and Abul Hasan not heeding the warning wrote to Bijapur the only other Deccan Sultanate standing, proposing to send 40,000 men to his help and to secure the assistance of Marathi leader, Sambha Ji. The letter fell into the hands of Aurangzeb and he immediately detached Prince Shah Alam with a large army to march on Golconda. Abul Hasan lost in this battle when Aurangzeb arrived on the battlefield with his main army and some heavy terms were imposed on him which also contain the orders for the dismissal of Madanna and Akkanna along with others. Abul Hasan put off the dismissal of Madanna and Akkanna until the discontented nobles, who regarded these men as the cause of all their misfortunes, lost all patience and murdered these brothers.   The dowager queen sent the heads of Madanna and Akkanna to Aurangzeb as a peace offering and Abul Hasan had a brief respite until Bijapur fell. But nothing could shake off Aurangzeb's determination to end Abul Hasan's rule resulting in him attacking Golconda in 1687. When Aurangzeb attacked Golconda, Abul Hasan fled to his fort and the city was occupied by the Mughals for the third time, under Ghazi-ud-din Firoz Jung, the father of the first Nizam. With the whole might of the Mughal Empire at his back, Aurangzeb beat incessantly for eight months against Golconda's fortifications with no results. Abdulla Khan Pani, a general in Golconda's army was bribed to open Golconda's gate allowing the Mughal army to pass through Fateh Darwaza at midnight. After a long siege of eight months, the kingdom of Golconda fell, not due to force but treachery. Abul Hasan was taken a prisoner and was sent to Daulatabad to spend the rest of his life. He was allotted Chini Mahal where he stayed, until his death in 1704 A.D. and was buried at Roza.
