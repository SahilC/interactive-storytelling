Muhammad Qutb Shah(1611 A.D.-1626A.D.)
As Muhammad Quli left no son to inherit, the next king was his nephew, Muhammad Qutb Shah, son of Muhammad Arain, who was the sixth son of King Ibrahim Qutb Shah. Muhammad Qutb Shah was also the son-in-law of the late king, having married his daughter Hayat Baksh Begum. Muhammad Qutb Shah was born in April 1593 and ascended the throne of Golconda on the 17th December 1611. His reign of fourteen years was uneventful, it was the lull before the storm. He was a historian and philosopher, and although he did not neglect the duties of his kingly office, most of his time was spent in study and exchanges with the learned men whom he encouraged at his court. The Qutb Shah chronicles were compiled during his reign. He laid out some gardens to add to the beauty of his capital, but his principal undertaking was the foundation of the Mecca Masjid in the city of Hyderabad, leaving the building to be continued by his successors. In Muhammad Qutb Shah's reign, the Dutch established themselves at Machilipatnam 1615 and the English in 1622. Muhammad Qutb Shah died on the 11th February 1626.
