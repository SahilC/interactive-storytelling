Jamshed Qutb Shah(1543 A.D-1550 A.D.)
Jamshed Qutb Shah ascended the throne on the death of his father in 1543 A.D. One of his first acts was to try to seize his younger brother Ibrahim, who was governor of one of the Telangana forts. Ibrahim fled to Bidar and later found shelter at Vijaynagar, where the Great Rama Raya was reigning. Soon after Jamshed's accession Ali Barid, king of Bidar waged war against Golconda. He was within seven miles of the fort before Jamshed knew of his coming. Immediately Jamshed collected a force and marched on Bidar, forcing Ali Barad to withdraw to save his own capital. Jamshed was a warlike ruler and a man of considerable sagacity. He interfered far more than was the custom with his successors in conflicts between the sultans of Deccan. During his reign he bore a part in various quarrels between the kings of Ahmednagar, Bidar and Bijapur, his clever diplomacy invariably guiding him to espouse the cause of the winning side. He was also a poet. About two years before he died Jamshed was stricken with cancer. During the end of his reign, many paid the maximum penalty for the most trivial offences. Jamshed died early in 1550 A.D., after reigning nearly seven years.
