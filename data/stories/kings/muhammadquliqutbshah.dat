Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah(1580 A.D-1611 A.D.)
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was born on the 8th April 1566 and ascended the throne on the death of his father in 1580. During his long, peaceful and prosperous reign the dynasty reached its zenith. The time which his predecessors gave for the battlefield, he devoted to the improvement and embellishment of his capital. As time passed, Golconda became very unhealthy through over-population, and in 1591 the king built a magnificent city a few miles away, which he named Bhagnagar to commemorate his favorite mistress, Bhagmati. After her death, the king was persuaded to change the name of the city to Haidarabad which changed to Hyderabad with the passage of time. In the new city, which was laid out on the "gridiron" principle, there were two important crossings over the main road. At the junction with the road from Golconda, Muhammad Quli built the Char Minar in 1593, and at the crossing to Masulipatam, he erected the Gulzar Hauz. In the same year, the Purana Pul was built. Muhammad Quli also built the Dar-us-Shifa and in 1594 commenced the Ashur Khana. In 1598 the Jami Masjid was erected near the Char Minar. The Dad Mahal was built about the same time. Several palaces were erected, e. g. the Chandav Mahal, Hira Mahal, Lakhan Mahal, and the Nadi Mahal. Only the names of many of these remain today. Muhammad Quli made extensive additions to the fort of Golconda. During his reign, Kurnool, Nandial, Dole, Gandikota and Kadapa in the south were added to the Golconda dominions and inroads were made into the eastern districts of Nellore. In 1611, the first venture on behalf of the East India Company was made in his time at Masulipatam. Muhammad Quli apart from being a just and capable king was also a poet. He died after a brief illness, in the thirty-second year of his reign, on the 17th December 1611.
