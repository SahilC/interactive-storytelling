Subhan Quli Qutb Shah(1550 A.D.-1550 A.D.)
When Jamshed died, his son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah, seven years old, was placed on the throne. His exit from the arena of history is as premature as his entrance into it. After being on the throne for about six months he passes out of our knowledge completely. His death is not recorded, nor is it known where he was buried.
