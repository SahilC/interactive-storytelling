Subhan Quli Qutb Shah(1550 A.D.-1550 A.D.)
When Jamshed died, his son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah, seven years old, was placed on the throne. He was a patron of Telugu language in the Qutub shahi court and literature on the legacy of His Noble Grandfather Sultan Quli Qutub shah. Saif Khan, also known as Ainul Mulk, was sent from Ahmednagar for the performance of duties of regent during the boy's development. But Jamsheed's younger brother Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah returned from Vijayanagara to Golconda, and ascended the throne. His exit from the arena of history is as premature as his entrance into it. After being on the throne for about six months he passes out of our knowledge completely. His death is not recorded, nor is it known where he was buried.
