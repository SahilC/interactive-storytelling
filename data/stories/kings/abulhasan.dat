After Abdulla Qutb Shah's death in 1672, his youngest son-in-law, Abul Hasan ascended the throne and entrusted the affairs of state to his Prime Minister Madanna. In 1683 Emperor Aurangzeb collected all the forces of the empire to make one grand and final attack upon the Deccan and reconquer it after a fitful series of wars begun by his Great Grandfather, Akbar. Aurangzeb marched at the head of what is known as the Grand Army. Aurangzeb warned Abul Hasan not to interfere and Abul Hasan not heeding the warning wrote to Bijapur the only other Deccan Sultanate standing, proposing to send 40,000 men to his help and to secure the assistance of Marathi leader, Sambha Ji. The letter fell into the hands of Aurangzeb and he immediately detached Prince Shah Alam with a large army to march on Golconda. Abul Hasan lost in this battle when Aurangzeb arrived on the battlefield with his main army and some heavy terms were imposed on him which also contain the orders for the dismissal of Madanna and Akkanna along with others. Abul Hasan put off the dismissal of Madanna and Akkanna until the discontented nobles, who regarded these men as the cause of all their misfortunes, lost all patience and murdered these brothers.   The dowager queen sent the heads of Madanna and Akkanna to Aurangzeb as a peace offering and Abul Hasan had a brief respite until Bijapur fell. But nothing could shake off Aurangzeb's determination to end Abul Hasan's rule resulting in him attacking Golconda in 1687. When Aurangzeb attacked Golconda, Abul Hasan fled to his fort and the city was occupied by the Mughals for the third time, under Ghazi-ud-din Firoz Jung, the father of the first Nizam. With the whole might of the Mughal Empire at his back, Aurangzeb beat incessantly for eight months against Golconda's fortifications with no results. Abdulla Khan Pani, a general in Golconda's army was bribed to open Golconda's gate allowing the Mughal army to pass through Fateh Darwaza at midnight. After a long siege of eight months, the kingdom of Golconda fell, not due to force but treachery. Abul Hasan was taken a prisoner and was sent to Daulatabad to spend the rest of his life. He was allotted Chini Mahal where he stayed, until his death in 1704 A.D. and was buried at Roza.
