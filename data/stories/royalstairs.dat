These are the stairs used by the Royal family to travel from Durbar hall to their palaces. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter compared to the other ones. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals. To keep the palanquins stable horizontally, two of the people carrying used to be tall and the other two used to be short.
