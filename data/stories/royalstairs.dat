These are the stairs used by the Royal family to travel from Durbar hall to their palaces. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter compared to the other ones. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals. To keep the palanquins stable horizontally, two of the people carrying used to be tall and the other two used to be short. Coming down the Royal Stairs, the Sultan's palanquin had to pass by this place to reach other structures like Kilwat, Rani Mahal, and Dad Mahal. This is where the Bodyguards guarding the Zenana and the path to Durbar Hall used to have quarters. Since this path was used by the king frequently, and it is the only way to the stairs reaching Durbar Hall, it used to be heavily guarded. These quarters are also close to the mosque used by the ladies of the Imperial Harem to offer their prayers.
