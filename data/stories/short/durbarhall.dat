At the summit of the hill is the three-storeyed breezy Durbar Hall also known as Baradari with a rooftop pavilion. The ventilation system of the Durbar Hall is designed to allow cool breeze reach the interiors of the fort. At a particular location near this Durbar Hall, one can hear the clapping sound produced at Clapping portico near Balahissar Darwaza. Using this as a means of communication, guards posted at the entrance used to inform the guards at the Durbar Hall about any visitors wanting to meet the king.  The lower storey of the Durbar Hall was used by the king to have audience with general public and the upper storey was used by the king to have private audience with special guests of Golconda. The rumoured secret tunnel from Golconda to Charminar and Gosha Mahal which was said to be designed for the escape of royal family is said to be in Durbar Hall.
