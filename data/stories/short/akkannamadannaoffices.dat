Taking the path straight from Clapping Portico and passing by Victoria Cannon, one can reach the pathway with Guest Rooms on the left side which are built below the ground level. This is where the royal guests used to stay. A mosque was also built for the guests to offer their prayers. Just after the Guest Rooms lies the secretariat of the Qutb Shahi’s, bearing many rooms. This place was used by many clerks and lower officials serving the fort as their offices to maintain fort records. If carefully observed, the inside of the complex is built in such a way to let enough sunlight for the functioning of the secretariat and there are holes drilled in the walls for curtains to be tied to separate each room. These were the same offices occupied by the famous Akkanna and Madanna brothers during their tenure as ministers for Abul Hasan, the Eighth and last King of Golconda. As the last king of Golconda was being so refined in his pleasures, the kingdom was ably managed by Madanna so much that his power was felt beyond Golconda. When the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb attacked and won against Golconda for the first time in 1685, one of the terms imposed on Golconda was the dismissal of Akkanna-Madanna duo. Even facing the impending doom, the king of Golconda couldn’t dismiss the brother duo of which he knew their value in warring times. Proceeding further down this path, Nagina Bagh can be seen on the right side.
