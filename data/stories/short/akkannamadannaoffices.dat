The rooms to the left the pathway which are built below the ground level were allotted to Guests. A mosque was also built for the guests to offer their prayers. Just after the Guest Rooms lies the secretariat of the Qutb Shahiâ€™s which was used by many clerks and lower officials serving the fort as their offices to maintain fort records. If carefully observed, the inside of the complex is built in such a way to let enough sunlight for the functioning of the secretariat and there are holes drilled in the walls for curtains to be tied to separate each room. These were the same offices occupied by the famous Akkanna and Madanna brothers during their tenure as ministers for Abul Hasan, the Eighth King of Golconda.
