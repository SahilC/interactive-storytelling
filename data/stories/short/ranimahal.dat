The queen of the Golconda and other Royal ladies used to stay in these once two-storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. These same walls were also used to be decorated with diamonds and gems before they were plundered by the Mughal army. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is a Shahi Hammam which was a Royal Bathtub. Even though mostly destroyed, we could still see the ceramic pipelines, that carried hot and cold water using different passages along with a separate outlet for drain water to flow out. Rooms situated on the ground floor of Rani Mahal were used by the women of the palace to entertain guests. The Sultan sitting in the first floor, to keep tabs on what was discussed, could even listen in on private conversations because the walls were designed to amplify sound to the next floor.
