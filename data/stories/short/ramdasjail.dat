Walking down the Commoner stairs and after passing by the Upper Tank, a small door can be seen on a rocky structure on the left side of the stairs. This is where Kancherla Goppana also known as Ramdas was imprisoned for embezzling Royal funds to build a temple for Lord Ram at Bhadrachalam. Ramdas worked as a tax collector for one of the Golconda divisions. When Abul Hasan, the eighth ruler of Golconda got wind of this embezzlement, he imprisoned Ramdas for Twelve years before releasing him. Food was provided to him from the openings in the ceiling. During his imprisonment, Ramdas etched the silhouettes of Hindu God Ram along with others on the walls of the prison. This structure was believed to be used as part of granary before imprisoning Ramdas. Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana has a Persian inscription on black basalt stating that it was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary used to store food rations for the entire Golconda fort. During the final war with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when Golconda fort was laid a siege, it was not only defences but well planned granaries that helped in survival of Golconda forces.
