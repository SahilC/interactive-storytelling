Walking down the Commoner stairs and after passing by the Upper Tank, a small door can be seen on a rocky structure on the left side of the stairs. This is where Kancherla Goppana also known as Ramdas was imprisoned for twelve years for embezzling Royal funds to build a temple for Lord Ram at Bhadrachalam. During his imprisonment, Ramdas etched the silhouettes of Hindu Gods on the walls of the prison. This structure was believed to be used as part of granary before imprisoning Ramdas. Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary for food.
