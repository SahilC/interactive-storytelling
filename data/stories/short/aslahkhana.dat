Also called as Silah Khana, This place was used as armoury during Qutub Shahi times. It is said to have around 150 rooms. Some of the long cannons with quite a few cannon balls are displayed in one of the large arched windows here. Since Silah Khana is an essential structure to fort defences, it is situated close to Balahissar gate.
