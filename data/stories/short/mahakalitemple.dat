This is a Hindu temple which belongs to the Kakatiya period. It is carved out of a huge boulder and has colourful frescos of the Goddess Kali on the white-painted facade. This temple is said to be found by some shepherds when roaming around this hill. Taking their advice, the Kakatiyas, the then rulers of Warangal kingdom erected a mud fort around this hill and named this hill as “Golla Konda” meaning “Shepherd’s Kill”. This is a small cave temple and the original idols are kept inside the cave.
