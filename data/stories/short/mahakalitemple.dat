This is a Hindu temple belonging to the Kakatiya period which was carved out of a huge boulder. This temple is said to be found by some shepherds when roaming around this hill. Taking their advice, the Kakatiyas, the then rulers of Warangal kingdom erected a mud fort around this hill and named this hill as “Golla Konda” meaning “Shepherd’s Hill”. This is a small cave temple and the original idols are kept inside the cave.
