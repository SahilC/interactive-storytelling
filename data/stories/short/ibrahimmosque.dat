Ibrahim Mosque was built by the fourth king of Golconda, Ibrahim Qutub Shah. Ibrahim mosque was built on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets which are located on the south and north sides, with their bulbous-shaped dome and two balconies. This is a unique style of the medieval Deccan architecture usually found in early Qutb Shahi monuments, the famous one being Charminar. This is a small mosque with three entrances and one span in depth. The entire roof is surrounded by a parapet with battlements. The courtyard of the mosque extends up to the ramparts, providing magnificent views of the landscape below. At the base, it has nine small arches. The external stucco decorations represent typical Qutb Shahi art style.
