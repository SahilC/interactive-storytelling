Ibrahim Mosque was built by the fourth king of Golconda, Ibrahim Qutub Shah on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets, with their bulbous-shaped dome and two balconies. This is a unique style of the medieval Deccan architecture usually found in early Qutb Shahi monuments, the famous one being Charminar. The entire roof is surrounded by a parapet with battlements.
