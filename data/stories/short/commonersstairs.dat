Following the path from the Nagina Bagh to the Commoner stairs, one can see the Lower tank on the right side. After the wonderful acoustic system, the clever water supply system of the Qutb Shahis stands out. This ingenious water supply system ensured that tanks in the palace had a continuous supply. Water from a lake named Durgam cheruvu, situated some 5 kilometres away, was transmitted through an open channel using earthen pipes which passed through the Qutb Shahi tombs to the Golconda Fort. This is the first and lower tank which used to collect water from the lake directly. From here, water used to be sent to other tanks using earthen pipes. Water received from the lake was stored in Golconda using an arrangement of three tanks. These three tanks were constructed diagonally with respect to each other up the slope of the hill and simple science was used to automatically pump water from one tank at the foot of the hill to the other tank situated up the hill. After passing by Nagina Bagh, following the path, one will reach the foot of a long staircase meant for commoners which will lead the way to the Durbar hall. Other monuments like Ramdas Jail, Ambar Khana, Ibrahim Mosque, and MahaKali Temple can be seen while walking down this path. The second tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the first tank can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas jail. These tanks have pipes at their bottom and top. Water was filled in these tanks using the pipes connected to the top of these tanks. When the pressure got increased at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of water, pipes at bottom of the tank used to pump water to the next tank. The third and last tank in the three tank series which is located uphill to the second tank can be seen on the left side while walking down the Commoner Stairs towards Ramdas Jail. This tank receives water from the second tank and distributes it to the entire fort. Since, this tank is located at a higher altitude, gravity does all the work in distributing water to all other places in the fort.
