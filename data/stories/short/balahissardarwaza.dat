Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Fort gate using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered in front of Fort gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. Due to it’s shorter distance from the Fort gate, even Battering Elephants couldn’t build up enough charge to break the Fort’s entrance gate. For enemies still wishing to try their luck with using Battering Elephants to batter the gate, Fort gate has it's own surprises waiting for them! Standing between the enemy forces and the king of Golconda is Balahissar Darwaza, the final defence structure of the fort. This entrance stands right next to curtain wall and leads the way to the inside of the fort. Being the main entrance to the fort, Balahissar Darwaza welcomes guests with it’s pleasant decorations. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels used as the part of decoration to the entrance, serve as the proof of the acknowledgement and harmonious nature of the Qutb Shahi’s to the multi-cultural society. Several spike like structures were placed on Balahissar Darwaza to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza. This well thought out piece of design tells us much about the defence tactics employed by the forts of this type. Upon entering the inner fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico which was a vital structure in Fort’s communication network. This portico stands as a proof to sophisticated and wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from the top of the hill a few hundred meters away. Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill, using different codes by clapping. One clap for a friend, two for a foe, three for an honored guest, and so on. In the case of a foe, the outer walls were shut at once. There is a Cannon placed under clapping portico, which acts as a great tourist attraction. This cannon was presented by Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the left side of the cannon. This cannon was placed at Golconda Fort following the orders of Nizam.
