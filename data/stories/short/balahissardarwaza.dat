Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. This wall was meant to stop the large enemy force from attacking at a time. Enemies gathered in front of Fort gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a ram or even an elephant to batter the gate, because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate. Balahissar Darwaza is the final defence structure of the fort. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels used as the part of the decoration, serve as the proof of the acknowledgement of the Qutb Shahi’s to the multi-cultural society. Darwaza was studded with spikes to stop elephants from battering it down. Hot boiled oil or molten lead was let down on Attackers through an opening present at the tip of the arch. Upon entering through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico, a vital structure in Fort’s communication network. A clap below the Portico can be heard from the top of the hill a few hundred meters away. Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a guard stationed here would communicate it to the guards atop the hill, using different codes by clapping. The cannon placed under clapping portico was presented by Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. It cannon was placed at Golconda Fort following the orders of Nizam.
