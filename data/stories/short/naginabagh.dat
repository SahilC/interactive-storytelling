Nagina Bagh which means “Jewel among the Gardens” has a square layout divided into quadrants by paved pathways converging into a fountain located at the centre of the gardens. Nagina Bagh was the place where the famous International Diamond trade used to take place. A small Mosque can be seen at a corner of Nagina Bagh which was built for the merchants to offer their prayers. When entering the Nagina Bagh following the Victoria Cannon, at the foot of the tree, there is a block of iron weighing more than 200kgs. During Qutb Shahi Period, citizens who lifted this weight using a single hand were eligible for entry in the Sultan's army.
