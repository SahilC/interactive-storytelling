Nagina Bagh which means “Jewel among the Gardens” has a square layout divided into quadrants by paved pathways converging into a fountain located at the centre of the gardens. Nagina Bagh was the place where the famous International Diamond trade used to take place. At the entrance to Nagina Bagh, there is a block of iron weighing more than 200kgs. During Qutb Shahi Period, citizens who lifted this weight using a single hand were eligible for entry in the Sultan's army.
