Another live example of the wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda is Dad Mahal, also known as Hall of Justice. The king sitting in the balcony used to hear grievances of the people and pass judgements on criminals at this place. This arrangement doesn't allow any commoners to see the Sultan and helped in avoiding assassination attempts that might have happened in the court. The person presenting his case had to stand below the portico and speak out his grievance. The porticos were designed in such a way that even a whisper at one end of it can be heard from the other end. This eliminated the threat from any concealed weapons which would get their sound amplified while trying to be drawn.
