This is where the Bodyguards guarding the Zenana, and the path to Durbar Hall used to have quarters. Since this path was used by the king frequently, and as it was the only way to the stairs reaching Durbar Hall, it used to be heavily guarded. There are stairs were used by the Royal family to travel from Durbar hall to their palaces which pass through this place. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter compared to the other ones. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals. To keep the palanquins stable horizontally, two of the people carrying used to be tall and the other two used to be short. Coming down the Royal Stairs, the Sultan's palanquin had to pass by this structure to reach other monuments ahead.
