This was where the Bodyguards guarding the Zenana used to have quarters. Since this path was also frequented by the king, it used to be heavily guarded. The stairs ahead were used by the king to travel from Durbar Hall to other places. Steps here are built steep so as to make the length of staircase shorter. Palanquins were used for to and fro transport of the Royals.
