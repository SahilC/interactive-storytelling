Coming down the Royal Stairs, the Sultan's palanquin had to pass by this place to reach other structures like Kilwat, Rani Mahal, and Dad Mahal. This is where the Bodyguards guarding the Zenana and the path to Durbar Hall used to have quarters. Since this path was used by the king frequently, and it is the only way to the stairs reaching Durbar Hall, it used to be heavily guarded. These quarters are also close to the mosque used by the ladies of the Imperial Harem to offer their prayers.Secluded from other locations and surrounded by walls lies a small mosque near the bodyguard quarters of Zenana. This is a prayer place for the Royal women and other women staying in women's area, the Zenana. Women in imperial harem did not have any restriction on where to pray. But, for women wanting privacy and their own place for worship, this mosque was constructed by Qutb Shahis.Just next to Kilwat, on the right side of it's wall is a Dressing room. This dressing room which was often used by the women in Zenana used to be filled with mirrors, perfumes and other extravagant makeup materials known at that time. There is also a small bathtub present at the middle of the dressing room. This was the same dressing room used by famous dancers Taramati and Premamati who were employed in the court of Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda.
