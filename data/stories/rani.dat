Holding precious memories of all the Begums that stayed here, Rani Mahal stands today in a battered position standing between Kilwat and Taramati mosque. The queen of the King of Golconda and other Royal ladies used to stay in these once two-storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. These same walls were also used to be decorated with diamonds and gems before they were plundered by the Mughal army. Rani mahal complex was a two-storeyed structure until it was destroyed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb during his attack on Golconda. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is a Shahi Hammam which survived the onslaught of the Mughal army and was used to serve as Royal Bathtub. Even though mostly destroyed, we could still see the ceramic pipelines, that carried hot and cold water using different passages. It had a separate outlet or drain water to flow out. Among the other things that remain today, a small room still remains intact. This room was used by the King and Queen of Golconda to watch over court proceedings of Dad Mahal and was designed in a way to protect them from unexpected trouble that might arise during a court proceeding.
