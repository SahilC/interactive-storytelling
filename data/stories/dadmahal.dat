Another live example of the wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda, Dad Mahal lies in between Taramati Mosque and Kilwat. This hall is also known as Hall of Justice. Sultan used to hear grievances of the people and pass judgements on criminals at this place. This hall is filled with porticos. They have been designed in such a way that even a whisper at one end of a portico can be heard from the other end of it. Sultan used to sit on the balcony overseeing the proceedings. This arrangement doesn't allow any commoners to see the Sultan and helped in avoiding assassination attempts that might have happened in the court. Soldiers would collect any document that the people would want to submit to Sultan and drop it in a canister which used to be hung from the first floor by one of the Sultan's servants. These servants used to collect the documents from the canister after pulling it up and read the contents to the Sultan. The person presenting his case had to stand below the portico and speak out his grievance. Standing below the portico and by speaking or even making a sound, one can hear it getting amplified. This eliminated the threat from any concealed weapons which would get their sound amplified while trying to be drawn.
