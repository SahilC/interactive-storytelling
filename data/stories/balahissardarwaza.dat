Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. The original Curtain Wall was much bigger and was destroyed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb during the final war between Mighty Mughal Empire and Golconda Sultanate, the last standing Deccan Sultanate.Although, current wall is a replica of the original wall built in Twentieth Century it provides enough insight to people in understanding the functioning of Golconda fort’s mighty defences.This structure is a semi-circular shaped wall aimed to slow down enemy forces attacking Golconda fort. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Balahissar Darwaza using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered in front of Balahissar gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. Due to it’s shorter distance from the Balahissar Darwaza, even Battering Elephants couldn’t build up enough charge to break the Fort’s entrance gate. For enemies still wishing to try their luck with using Battering Elephants to batter the gate, Balahissar Darwaza has it's own surprises waiting for them. Standing between the enemy forces and the king of Golconda is Balahissar Darwaza, the final defence structure of the fort. This entrance stands right next to curtain wall and leads the way to the inside of the fort through Clapping Portico,  which played an important role in fort’s communication networks. Being the main entrance to the fort, Balahissar Darwaza welcomes guests with it’s pleasant decorations. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels used as the part of decoration to the entrance, serve as the proof to the acknowledgement and harmonious nature of the Qutb Shahi’s to the multi-cultural society. Apart from the visual attraction, Balahissar Darwaza, working along side with Curtain Wall also acted as a vital defence structure to the fort. Like every other gate, Balahissar Darwaza’s main function is to keep the unwanted out and for this purpose, the designers of the gate employed quite a few tactics. Several spike like structures can be seen on Balahissar Darwaza which were placed tactically on it to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza. This well thought out piece of design tells us much about the defence tactics employed by the forts of this type. Upon entering the inner fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico which was a vital structure in Fort’s communication network. From here, the path gets divided into two parts, left one leading by the Aslah Khana and straight one by the Akkanna Madanna Offices. This portico stands as a proof to sophisticated and wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from Durbar hall located a few hundred meters away at the top of the hill. This communication system was used to relay important and urgent messages from here to the Durbar Hall. Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill, using different codes by clapping. One clap for a friend, two for a foe, three for an honoured guest, and so on. Incase of a foe, the outer walls were shut at once. This is a Cannon placed under clapping portico, which acts as a great tourist attraction. This cannon was presented by Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the left side of the cannon. This cannon was placed at Golconda Fort following the orders of Nizam. Climbing the steps to the cannon, one can notice that the path from here is divided into two parts, straight one leading to the Akkanna Madanna offices and the right one leading to the Nagina Bagh.
