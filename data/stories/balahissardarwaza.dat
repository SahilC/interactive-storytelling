Standing between the enemy forces and the king of Golconda is Balahissar Darwaza, the final defence structure of the fort. This entrance stands right next to curtain wall and leads the way to the inside of the fort through Clapping Portico,  which played an important role in fort’s communication networks. Being the main entrance to the fort, Balahissar Darwaza welcomes guests with it’s pleasant decorations. Mythical beasts and lions on stucco panels of the spandrels used as the part of decoration to the entrance, serve as the proof to the acknowledgement and harmonious nature of the Qutb Shahi’s to the multi-cultural society. Apart from the visual attraction, Balahissar Darwaza, working along side with Curtain Wall also acted as a vital defence structure to the fort. Like every other gate, Balahissar Darwaza’s main function is to keep the unwanted out and for this purpose, the designers of the gate employed quite a few tactics. Several spike like structures can be seen on Balahissar Darwaza which were placed tactically on it to stop elephants from battering down this door. Attackers directly trying to force open the door would have been greeted with hot boiled oil or molten lead which was let down on them through an opening present at the tip of the arch of the Balahissar Darwaza. This well thought out piece of design tells us much about the defence tactics employed by the forts of this type.
