At the summit of the hill is the three-storeyed breezy Durbar Hall with a rooftop pavilion. Also known as Baradari, this is the highest point in the fort and is also the final destination for people following either Commoner Stairs or Royal Stairs. The ventilation system of the Durbar Hall is absolutely fabulous having exotic designs. They were so intricately designed that cool breeze could reach the interiors of the fort, providing a respite from the heat of summer. At a particular location near this Durbar Hall, one can hear the clapping sound produced at Clapping portico near Balahissar Darwaza. Using this as a means of communication, guards posted at the entrance used to inform the guards at the Durbar Hall about any visitors wanting to meet the king. Durbar Hall is a double-storeyed structure and depending on the social class of visitor, the meeting venue would be decided. The lower storey of the Durbar Hall was used by the king to have audience with general public and the upper storey was used by the king to have private audience with special guests of Golconda, and was known as Diwan-e-Aam. From the roof of Durbar hall, the king used to catch a view of the entire city of Hyderabad. Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda is said to have used to sit on top of this Durbar Hall frequently to watch and hear his favourite courtesan and dancer perform and sing at a Serai, a road-side inn which was constructed by early Qutb Shahiâ€™s, two kilometers away from Golconda fort on the bank of Musi river. This Sarai later got renamed to Taramati Baradari in honour of the dancer, Taramati by Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda. The rumoured secret tunnel from Golconda to Charminar and Gosha Mahal which was said to be designed for the escape of royal family is said to be in Durbar Hall.
