Just above the Ramdas Jail on the Commoner stairs, lies Ambar Khana. The Ambar Khana has a Persian inscription on black basalt stating that it was built by Khairat Khan between 1626 and 1672 during the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. This was the granary used to store food rations for the entire Golconda fort. During the final war with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when Golconda fort was laid a siege, it was not only defences but well planned granaries that helped in survival of Golconda forces.
