Blocking the way to enemy intruders, Curtain wall is the first structure that is encountered when entering the inner fort of Golconda. The original Curtain Wall was much bigger and was destroyed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb during the final war between Mighty Mughal Empire and Golconda Sultanate, the last standing Deccan Sultanate.Although, current wall is a replica of the original wall built in Twentieth Century it provides enough insight to people in understanding the functioning of Golconda fort’s mighty defences.This structure is a semi-circular shaped wall aimed to slow down enemy forces attacking Golconda fort. This wall is a tactical defence structure performing it's duties in two main ways. Enemy entering Golconda fort cannot attack the Balahissar Darwaza using large force, since this wall allows entry to only small force and thus have to split weakening their strength. Enemies gathered in front of Balahissar gate after passing by curtain wall cannot use a battering ram because of the shorter distance between Curtain wall and the gate, thus pinning down attackers for fort archers. Due to it’s shorter distance from the Balahissar Darwaza, even Battering Elephants couldn’t build up enough charge to break the Fort’s entrance gate. For enemies still wishing to try their luck with using Battering Elephants to batter the gate, Balahissar Darwaza has it's own surprises waiting for them!
