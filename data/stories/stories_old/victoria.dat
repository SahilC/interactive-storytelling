This is a Cannon placed under clapping portico, which acts as a great tourist attraction. This cannon was presented by Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the left side of the cannon. This cannon was placed at Golconda Fort following the orders of Nizam. Climbing the steps to the cannon, one can notice that the path from here is divided into two parts, straight one leading to the Akkanna Madanna offices and the right one leading to the Nagina Bagh.
