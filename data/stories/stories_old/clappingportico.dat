Upon entering the inner fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico which was a vital structure in Fort’s communication network. From here, the path gets divided into two parts, left one leading by the Aslah Khana and straight one by the Akkanna Madanna Offices. This portico stands as a proof to sophisticated and wonderful acoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from Durbar hall located a few hundred meters away at the top of the hill. This communication system was used to relay important and urgent messages from here to the Durbar Hall. Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill, using different codes by clapping. One clap for a friend, two for a foe, three for an honoured guest, and so on. Incase of a foe, the outer walls were shut at once.
