Just next to Kilwat, on the right side of it's wall is a Dressing room. This dressing room which was often used by the women in Zenana used to be filled with mirrors, perfumes and other extravagant makeup materials known at that time. There is also a small bathtub present at the middle of the dressing room. This was the same dressing room used by famous dancers Taramati and Premamati who were employed in the court of Abdulla Qutb Shah, the seventh king of Golconda.
