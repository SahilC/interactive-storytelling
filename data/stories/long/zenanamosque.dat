Secluded from other locations and surrounded by walls lies a small mosque near the bodyguard quarters of Zenana. This is a prayer place for the Royal women and other women staying in women's area, the Zenana. Women in imperial harem did not have any restriction on where to pray. But, for women wanting privacy and their own place for worship, this mosque was constructed by Qutb Shahis.
