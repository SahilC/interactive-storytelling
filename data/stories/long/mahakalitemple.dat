This is the last structure to be encountered before Durbar Hall while walking by the Commoner Stairs. This is a Hindu temple which belongs to the Kakatiya period. It is carved out of a huge boulder and has colourful frescos of the Goddess Kali on the white-painted facade. This temple is said to be found by some shepherds when roaming around this hill. Taking their advice, the Kakatiyas, the then rulers of Warangal kingdom erected a mud fort around this hill and named this hill as “Golla Konda” meaning “Shepherd’s Kill”. Even after nine hundred years, this temple stands strong. This is a small cave temple and the original idols are kept inside the cave. It is said that Akkanna, the minister of Abul Hasan, the eighth king of Golconda used to offer his prayers at this temple regularly. This temple stands right next to Durbar Hall where King held his official meetings, and also next to Ibrahim Mosque but still, never faced any sort of destruction from Qutb Shahis, which tells us a lot about their respect for all faiths. Being a small temple doesn’t stop thousands of devotees from visiting it each year. The famous festival of Bonalu celebrated by people of Hyderabad in the months of July and August starts from this small cave temple of Mahakali.
