Situated at the first floor of Rani Mahal, this place was a bathtub for Kings and Queens. A portion of water from the tanks was heated up and was routed to the Shahi Hammam. There were different earthen pipes for hot and cold water. Another set of earthen pipes were used to dispose the water from the bath.
