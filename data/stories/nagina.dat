Taking the path to the right side of the Victoria Cannon, one can reach Nagina Bagh. Nagina Bagh which means “Jewel among the Gardens” has a square layout divided into quadrants by paved pathways converging into a fountain located at the centre of the gardens. Nagina Bagh was the place where the famous Diamond trade used to take place. Merchants from different countries used to come here to buy the diamonds and other valuable stones. A small Mosque can be seen at a corner of Nagina Bagh which was built for the merchants to offer their prayers. When entering the Nagina Bagh following the Victoria Cannon, at the foot of the tree, there is a block of iron weighing more than 200kgs. During Qutb Shahi Period, citizens who lifted this weight using a single hand were eligible for entry in the Sultan's army. This tells us about the fitness level of the Qutb Shahi army and the strict protocol they followed in selecting soldiers. Proceeding further down on the path, stairs which were used by the common people to reach Durbar Hall can be accessed and various other monuments can be seen on the way. Located at one of the corners of the Nagina Bagh is a small mosque. This mosque was constructed by one of the Sultan's of Golconda for the merchants who used to visit the fort for their trade to offer their prayers.
