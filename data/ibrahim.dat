Right above the Ambar Khana to the left side of Commoner Stairs lies Ibrahim Mosque. This mosque was built by the fourth king Ibrahim Qutub Shah. This mosque was built on top of Ambar Khana and can be distinguished by the prominent corner minarets. The courtyard of the mosque extends up to the ramparts providing magnificent views of the landscape below. Ibrahim Mosque is a good example of Qutb Shahi architecture. This simple yet beautiful mosque is marked by three arches with the central being larger than the flanking smaller arches on itâ€™s either sides. At the base it has nine small arches. The external stucco decorations represent typical Qutb Shahi art style.
