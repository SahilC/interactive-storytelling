Standing between Kilwat and Taramati mosque is Rani Mahal holding precious memories of all the Begums that stayed here. The queen of Sultan and other Royal ladies used to stay in these two storeyed building. The walls are covered with decorative niches, alcoves and cornices, inspired by Persian design. On the first floor of this Mahal, there is Shahi Hammam which used to serve as Royal Bath tub. This first floor also has a small room from where Sultan and his Begum used to watch proceedings of Dad Mahal.
