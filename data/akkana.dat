Akkana (1) and Maddana (2) were the Hindu ministers during the rule of Abul Hasan Tanashah, the last Qutub Shahi ruler. They were known for their administrative skill and business acumen. There were no computers at that time, so filing the information of such a vast kingdom and informing the Sultan had to be very official. Check the holes in the walls, where curtains were used as room separators and shelves for storing the records. Follow the directions to reach the top of this office. A short climb up the stairs will take you there. The view from the top of the administrative office is good to take a picture. The good view helps you notice that the whole fort is built on natural rocks.

To move on, climb down the steps you came by and get on to the main path that lead you to the nagina bagh.
