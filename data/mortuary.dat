The Mortuary Baths lie to the right side of the Clapping Portico. The baths were meant for the deceased royalty and harem ladies(wives and concubines) who were given the ritualistic bath before burial outside the Banjara Gate.
Apart from the Clapping Portico, this cannon also greets anyone visiting the fort. This cannon was presented by the Queen Victoria of England to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1875 as a symbol of friendship. One can see the inscriptions of the year 1875 on the right side of the cannon. Following the orders of Nizam this cannon was placed at Golconda Fort. Climbing the steps to the cannon, one can notice that the path from here is divided into two parts, straight one leading to the Guest rooms and the right one leading to the Nagina Bagh.
Taking the path straight to Clapping Portico and passing by Victoria Cannon, one can reach the pathway with Guest Rooms on the left side which are built below the ground level. This is where the royal guests used to stay. Further down this path are Akkana-Madanna Office quarters.
