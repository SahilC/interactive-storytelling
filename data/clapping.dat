After you enter the Bala Hisar Darwaza, the first point is the clapping portico. This is where you began the journey into marvellous acoustics of the golconda fort. How would you communicate with a person on the top of the golconda fort without a cellphone or any wired form of communication? Can you think of a way ?

Let me reveal our low tech idea to solve this problem. Do you see anybody clapping on the portico ? When you clap at the centre of the dome in the portico, it reverberates and can be heard a kilometer away, at the top of the hill. This remarkable singalling method with an advanced knowledge of acoustics was used to communicate either the arrival of a visitor or a dignitary to the fort. It alerted the guards posted on the rooftop of the baradari and help to inform and take permission from the king for entry. Other applications for such advanced acoustics can be experienced by you in the other areas of the fort as well.

Now, observe the ceiling of this portico, shaped like a cut diamond which enables sound tranmission to different faraway points. The centre of this point is deflected by the different buildings and is carried to the "ulka". To the right of the portico are the mortuary baths, earthen pipes feed the large systems here, the source of hot and cold water. These baths were meant for deceased royalty and harem ladies were given a ritualistic bath before burial.

Step towards the cannon. Look towards the top left corner, slightly towards the sky. Do you see a structure with two minarets at the top of the hill ? The palace there is called the baradari. This is the only place where you can see all levels of the fort.
Upon entering the fort through Balahissar gate, we reach Clapping Portico. From here the path gets divided into two parts, left one leading to Aslah Khana and straight one to the Guest rooms. This portico helps in witnessing the sophisticated and wonderful accoustic system employed at Golconda. A clap below the Portico at a particular spot can be heard from Durbar hall located a few hundred meters away at the top of the hill.
Whenever visitors arrived at the gate, a man stationed here would communicate it to the Sultan’s guards atop the hill—by clapping. Codes were used: one clap for a friend, two for a foe (in which case, the gates along the outer walls would be shut at once, three for an honoured guest, and so on.
